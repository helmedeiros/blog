style: add trailing newlines to Co-Intelligence AI chapter posts

Add proper trailing newlines to both English and Portuguese versions of the 
Co-Intelligence AI chapter presentation posts for consistent formatting.

### What was changed:
- content/en/posts/2025-03-04-co-intelligence-ai-chapter.md - added trailing newline
- content/pt/posts/2025-03-04-co-intelligence-ai-chapter.md - added trailing newline

### Why this was done:
- Ensures consistent file endings across all blog posts
- Follows standard text file formatting conventions 
- Maintains clean git diffs and proper editor behavior
- Prevents potential formatting issues in markdown processors
- Keeps both language versions synchronized in structure

Minor formatting improvement that aligns with Hugo markdown best practices
and maintains consistency with other blog posts in the repository.
