fix: convert broken SlideShare embeds to functional HTML iframes

This commit resolves broken embedded content by converting old WordPress
SlideShare shortcodes to proper HTML iframe embeds that work in Hugo.

**Problem Identified:**

Blog posts contained 35 instances of broken SlideShare embeds using the old
WordPress shortcode format `[slideshare id=XXXXX&doc=filename]`. These
shortcodes are not supported in Hugo and were rendering as plain text,
making embedded presentations completely non-functional.

**Root Cause:**

During the WordPress to Hugo migration, the SlideShare shortcode processor
was not available, leaving the shortcodes unprocessed. This resulted in:
- Broken embedded presentations across multiple blog posts
- Poor user experience with non-functional content
- Missing visual aids that were integral to the posts

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Automated Conversion**: Created a script to systematically find and
   replace all SlideShare shortcodes with proper HTML iframe embeds

2. **Responsive Design**: Used modern iframe embedding with responsive
   styling that adapts to different screen sizes

3. **Preserved Functionality**: Maintained all original SlideShare
   presentation links and attribution

**Technical Details:**

- Converted shortcode pattern: `[slideshare id=XXXXX&doc=filename]`
- To HTML iframe: `<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/XXXXX">`
- Added responsive styling and proper attribution links
- Processed both English and Portuguese content directories

**Impact:**

- 35 blog posts now have functional embedded presentations
- All SlideShare content is properly accessible to readers
- Improved user experience with working multimedia content
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing post URLs

This fix completes the embedded content restoration, ensuring all
presentations that were previously broken are now fully functional
in the Hugo-based blog.
