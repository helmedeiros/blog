fix: resolve broken internal links and domain references

This commit fixes all remaining references to the old helmed.net domain that were
causing broken internal links and navigation issues throughout the blog.

**Issues Addressed:**

1. **Internal Cross-References**: Blog posts contained links to other posts using
   the old WordPress domain `http://www.helmed.net/blog/YYYY/MM/DD/post-title/`.
   These have been converted to relative paths `/YYYY/MM/DD/post-title/` for
   proper Hugo navigation.

2. **Attachment Links**: WordPress-style attachment links pointing to the old
   domain have been neutralized to prevent 404 errors.

3. **Configuration File**: Updated `content/pt/posts/config.yaml` to reference
   the current domain `https://old-blog.heliomedeiros.com` instead of the
   defunct `http://www.helmed.net/blog`.

4. **Generated Files**: Removed the `public/` directory containing stale
   references that will be regenerated with correct paths.

**Technical Changes:**
- Updated 17 markdown files with corrected internal link paths
- Converted absolute URLs to relative paths for domain independence
- Fixed blog post cross-references and presentation links
- Updated configuration to current hosting domain

**Benefits:**
- All internal navigation now works correctly
- Site is no longer dependent on external dead domains
- Improved SEO with proper internal linking structure
- Future-proof against domain changes
- Consistent relative path usage throughout

This complements the previous image path fixes, ensuring the entire blog
functions correctly without any broken links or external dependencies.
