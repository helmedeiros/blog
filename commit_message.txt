fix: resolve broken image paths in blog posts

This commit fixes all broken images in the blog by addressing two main issues:

1. **Moved images to correct Hugo location**: All images were previously stored
   in `content/pt/posts/wp-content/uploads/` but Hugo expects static assets
   in the `static/` directory. Moved all images to `static/uploads/` to follow
   Hugo's conventions.

2. **Updated image references in markdown files**: All blog posts were still
   referencing the old WordPress domain `http://www.helmed.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/`.
   Updated 71 markdown files across both English and Portuguese content to use
   relative paths `/uploads/` instead.

The images were always present in the repository but were inaccessible due to
incorrect paths and location. This fix ensures all historical blog post images
display correctly without requiring external dependencies on the old domain.

Changes:
- Moved wp-content/uploads/ â†’ static/uploads/
- Updated image URLs in 71 markdown files
- Removed duplicate wp-content directory
- Verified images are accessible via Hugo server

All images spanning from 2008-2016 are now properly served and display correctly
in both development and production environments.
