fix: restore missing markdown link references in English posts

This commit fixes broken markdown reference links in English blog posts by
restoring missing link definitions that were causing incomplete content and
broken navigation.

**Problem Identified:**

English posts contained markdown reference links like [1], [2], [3] within
the content but were missing the corresponding link definitions at the end
of the files. This resulted in:
- Broken links that didn't resolve to actual URLs
- Incomplete content compared to Portuguese versions
- Poor user experience with non-functional references

**Root Cause:**

During the WordPress to Hugo migration, the English translations lost their
markdown link reference definitions while retaining the reference markers
in the text. The Portuguese originals maintained complete link structures.

**Solution Applied:**

Created an automated script that:
1. Analyzed all 67 English posts for missing link references
2. Compared with corresponding Portuguese versions to identify missing definitions
3. Extracted and copied missing link references from Portuguese to English posts
4. Added complete link definitions at the end of each affected file

**Technical Details:**
- 33 out of 67 English posts (49%) had missing link references
- Some posts were missing 10+ individual link references
- All link definitions copied from Portuguese versions maintain original URLs
- References added at file end following markdown conventions

**Impact:**
- All English posts now have complete and functional link references
- Content parity achieved between English and Portuguese versions
- Improved user experience with working links throughout the blog
- No more broken [1], [2] style references in English content

This fix ensures that all blog content is complete and functional across
both languages, providing readers with access to all referenced materials
and external links as originally intended.
