feat: implement comprehensive blog post categorization system

Standardize all blog posts across both English and Portuguese with 6 target categories:
Technology, Agile, Events, Leadership, Architecture, and Management.

Why this change:
- Improves content discoverability through consistent categorization
- Enables effective filtering on the research-style homepage
- Provides better user experience with meaningful content organization
- Maintains bilingual consistency across EN/PT versions

What was implemented:
- Analyzed 300+ blog posts using intelligent keyword matching
- Updated 247 posts (109 EN + 138 PT) with proper categorization
- Used Portuguese keywords for PT content but English category names for consistency
- Fixed YAML frontmatter issues caused by category updates
- Maintained existing good categorizations where appropriate

Technical details:
- English posts: 71 Technology, 57 Events, 52 Agile, 29 Leadership, 24 Architecture, 20 Management
- Portuguese posts: 66 Technology, 59 Events, 58 Agile, 47 Leadership, 32 Architecture, 15 Management
- Total: 530 category assignments across 300 posts
- Hugo builds successfully with all new categorizations

This provides the foundation for enhanced blog filtering and better content organization
for readers interested in specific technical, methodological, or leadership topics.
