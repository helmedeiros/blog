refactor: simplify navigation by removing Work and Contact links

This commit streamlines the blog navigation to focus on core blog functionality
by removing external portal links that are not essential for the blog experience.

## Navigation Changes

### Removed Links
- **Work** link (previously pointed to https://heliomedeiros.com/work/)
- **Contact** link (previously pointed to https://heliomedeiros.com/contact/)

### Retained Links
- **hello.** (brand/home) - Blog homepage
- **About** - Redirects to main portal (https://heliomedeiros.com/)
- **Posts** - Blog posts listing
- **Language switcher** - Bilingual functionality (EN/PT)

## Rationale

The simplified navigation provides a cleaner, more focused user experience:

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Fewer navigation options make it easier for visitors to focus on blog content
2. **Clear Purpose**: Navigation now clearly distinguishes between blog content (Posts) and external portal (About)
3. **Improved UX**: Streamlined interface reduces decision fatigue for users
4. **Consistent Branding**: Maintains connection to main portal through About link without overwhelming the blog interface

## Technical Impact

- Cleaner HTML structure with fewer navigation elements
- Faster rendering due to reduced DOM complexity
- Maintained responsive design and mobile functionality
- Preserved all existing Hugo functionality and multilingual support

## User Journey

The simplified navigation creates a clear user flow:
- **Blog content consumption**: Posts link for reading articles
- **Author information**: About link to learn more about Helio
- **Language preference**: Language switcher for bilingual users
- **Return to blog**: hello. brand link to return to homepage

This change aligns the blog navigation with its primary purpose as a content
platform while maintaining essential connections to the broader digital presence.
