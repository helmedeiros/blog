Last Saturday, November 29th, 2011, I had the pleasure of exchanging many ideas during the second edition of a new event format that brings innovation to its name DESCONF!
Hosted by Dom Bosco Faculty, the DESCONF 2011 mustache edition declared freedom of expression as its theme, with an unconventional format that combined open spaces and lightning talks, having a representation of 62% of its registered participants as speakers, but which ultimately defines and debates their thought lines, not managing to offer anything less than a great learning day.
The event started at 9am with registration and an excellent coffee break. Upon entering, it was evident that the organizing team intended to promote a relaxed atmosphere with Rafael Bandeira and Felipe Cabral at the table with mustaches and beards respectively well-characterized, as well as Natalia Arsand who delivered fake mustaches for the youngsters!
Near 10am we had the first intervention in disarray organized, called by Bandeira, where we all went to the auditorium to do some activities to break the ice, with many applause to the organizers, sponsors and cheers! We defined the rules below and started the lightning talks.
- We shouldn't leave the camera's field of vision, so that ideas could reach more than 80 participants;
- Each presentation shouldn't exceed 5 minutes;
- Everyone should applaud at the end of these 5 minutes;
- And whoever spoke faster would be next.

The starting gun was given with a quick and relaxed presentation about facts, history and photos on the event's theme. There was no doubt that having a beard is synonymous with freedom, my wife who doesn't listen to me.... ðŸ™‚

I presented my vision on the possibility of project success beyond short learning cycles, as preached by Eric Ries, accompanied by promising ideas with current restrictive factors over time through the book of possibilities.

There were many convergences of ideas and complementary topics, and each new speaker brought a new surprise. People talked about mantras of possibilities, sailors' history and real efficiencies, about waking up the UAU in clients and how ideas converged more quickly in creative ecologies. We had insights on negotiation, hackerspaces, startups and their dark sides. Design and UX. All themes and tastes!

After all day, there was nothing left to do but thank everyone who participated for the ideas I heard and discussed. The pizzas were great and the atmosphere really conducive to learning and evolving ideas. And from the idea that #desconf should go mainstream, I leave the question of whether only experienced people should be heard, and Christian Heilmann's phrase "Where do known speakers come from?". VERY THANK YOU TO DESCONF! Let's come to the 2012 edition.
