I've been trying to create a culture of not only reading great posts, but also writing them. I've read several on the importance of knowledge dissemination and that's what I'm talking about in this recap post.

Another web service has been launched that reinforces the sharing of web knowledge, which was previously costly for "world.dev" bloggers who had to create their own small bandwagon for diagram visualization and more diagrams, which should be small enough not to take up too much space but not so small as to make it impossible to visualize and understand.

yUML presents a friendly interface and simplified inclusion method for making class and use case diagrams available.
