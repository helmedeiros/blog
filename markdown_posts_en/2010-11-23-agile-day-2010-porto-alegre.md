Tomorrow, November 24th, the AGILE DAY 2010 will take place at FACIN/PUCRS, promoted by the agile methodologies user group from Rio Grande do Sul. The event's programming is very interesting with 5 keynotes and various lightning talks and fishbowl conversations. We'll have Klaus Wuestefeld, who spoke at AGILE BRAZIL 2010, talking about the dilemma of focusing and maintaining software quality through rapid and urgent deliveries; André Nascimento from Stefanini on implementing agile methods in Stefanini; Luiz Faias from bluesoft on building a culture of learning; Paulo Caroli from TWBr on SW production line represented by cards on the wall; and Daniel Weinmann from Softa speaking about Crowdfunding and Agile – Ending the discussion between open and closed scope. Good speakers for a knowledge-packed day… the event starts at 08:30h and ends at 19:30! I hope to see you there!
