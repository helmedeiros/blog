Avoiding changes
He started talking about inertia, explaining that inertia doesn't mean being still, but it can be... Then how to get rid of this behavior with newcomers?
Caelum was small in 2009, but after 3 years, many... many... changes occurred, and in an team that believed in agility and its benefits, we may worry if we're still agile?

But first, we need to define what agility is, because they are still doing automated tests, collective ownership of code, courage, and other practices, but the uncertainty of agility worries. Because having practices doesn't mean we're still being agile, and that's when you notice we're losing sight of things, followed by more and more practices that are in place, asked why don't know. A bit of monkey experiment, everyone does what everyone else does!! But for Cecilia without understanding why there is no innovation, there is no change... it's inertia! Much is done, but always at the same pace, constant non-innovation.

Automated tests are excellent, but would you do these for a script that will run once and never be changed again? Three lines of code can be tested automatically and to avoid shame and not break the inertia. Practice is not rule! Doing something unnecessary because it's institutionalized doesn't move us towards anything better!

At this moment we pause to practice two practices: "How to identify inertia" and then "Rescuing agility", generating a debate and exchange of knowledge!

Identifying Inertia Rescuing Agility
This happened at Caelum, and inertia could have ended something very important for them, agility, and as something good and important there was an internal change shared with various initiatives! First, many ways to share knowledge were created among the whole team, in events like "brown bags" and incentives/expectations in event participations from the company itself. Then, a cultural change started to encourage novices' iteration, so they can teach, who teaches learns twice. Technical lunches for newcomers were also created, warm requests for their involvement in discussion lists, post creation.
If nothing works... let everyone fail, and then maybe re-initiate the process through a new search on how to solve them and believing in decision-making to get out of inertia, better change than just another brick on the wall!
