It happened today, April 11th, 2012, at the PUC-RS Faculty of Informatics, room 516, another meeting of the Agile Methodologies Group. 

The proposal Agile is to collaborate with the client and share expectations and responsibilities for project success! Not limiting choices!

Developers complain when a change in requirements goes through the bureaucratic process of change control. I thought the manifesto said something about embracing changes, many teams have their moment of fury with new requests for change... maybe another point we need to remember before daily meetings?

The leader of the project considers that documentation is more important than communication. This happens when the project produces a trail of paper, recording all decisions taken to ensure traceability of requirements, but despite this, no one in the team seems to understand what's really happening!! If something is important enough to be documented, it's important for everyone to know. You don't conquer commitment, maturity, or self-management without involving everyone in decision-making! Strengthen communication and responsibility!

Tests and quality verification are not integral and respected parts of the process. If your team doesn't care about quality first, how could it be self-managing well? How could it do anything without quality? All Agile approaches rely on tests for feedback validation on software quality. Therefore, guaranteeing test activities and quality are recognized as vital parts of the development process that must start on day 1 of the project. Delaying tests or quality assurance until the end of the project is a clear sign that the process is not Agile and probably it's not the process's fault...
