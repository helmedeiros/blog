Today we had another edition of HotSpot in the RBS Group, where I presented along with Cintia Lima the case about the challenges of launching paid content from the RBS Group newspapers tool; a project of great importance, which like others has a varied and exploratory scope prioritized/validated, built with a newly formed team.

In the presentation we raised points to which we attribute most of the success achieved, as a way to share replicable patterns in new projects with similar scenarios. By the end are presented new concepts that can help with the success of projects that use this pattern.
Below follows the presentation slides - Generating value â€“ Challenges in launching paid content:
