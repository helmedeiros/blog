Starting this session on my blog, I will present 4 mini-scenarios created during the first module of my Master's degree in Web Systems Projects, taught by Professor Osmar Fernandes Jr.

DESCRIPTION
Dalila is offering her friends from school, neighborhood, and club a web-based classified service.
Whoever advertises pays R$ 2.00 for a simple announcement of 20 words or R$5.00 for a highlighted page announcement that can contain up to 50 words and an image. The advertisement remains available for 15 days. Does not count: the product value, title text, contact name, up to two phone numbers, and one comment about the phones (e.g., from 6pm to 8pm).
Who becomes a subscriber of the virtual classified receives a daily email summary of site offers.
The customer can register sections of interest to receive new announcements via email without having to access the site.
