We had a debate in our Graduate Class recently about BDUF and whether it's possible to reduce the non-compilable document baggage through the composition of new templates alongside RUP, as endorsed by some school professionals with a closed scope. The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a software engineering process that offers an approach based on disciplines to assign tasks and responsibilities within a development organization; guided by the ABCDE principles of BDD, which ensures an adaptable process with priority level management and collaboration among team members.
