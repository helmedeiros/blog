What is agility in business? This was the initial question of Rebecca, probably the main point is to make deliveries faster with more value, where the business achieves more efficiency, with continuous measurements of hypotheses, and thus we can confirm them, then we can incorporate them.

And that's very interesting, because despite all this idea involved in the launch cycle of a product, we still haven't returned to the source after delivery to discover what to do next, or if it was really efficient this delivery.

For this to happen, Rebecca says that not only is necessary preparation at the technology level, continuous delivery or construction, but also need to align and explore how to unite their assumptions with the constancy of learning cycles agile.

It's already passed the crystal ball time, now we need to take decisions based and strategically aligned.

The development of these agile teams needs to start their journey with DoD (Definition of Done), aligning not just how close we are to delivering that new functionality or not. The business must always be aligned. Rebecca emphasized that being agile is a matter of principles! We should have them and not forced. The second step for these teams is prioritization and work on internal quality, because in this way, reflecting on metrics, understanding internal dependencies of systems or how messy or delayed we are. Knowing that, we can provide changes in the right places, without fear of the changes happening, about what will impact or when the decision to deliver a functionality will be impacted by the impossibility of happening.

The third point according to Rebecca for achieving this productive environment is learning and applying principles of evolutionary architectures. To follow this task, attention must be paid to code testability, because we can discover and evolve with fewer restrictions. We also need to pay attention to the minimum necessary information for complete functioning, such as addresses and CEPs, we don't need to restrict all of them, the important part is this information's CEP.

The fourth point is that teams know and share the idea of responsible at the last moment, we must know until when we can wait to take that decision, because the more time we have to learn, the more information we will have to take our decision. Additionally, the less we do, the fewer restrictions there will be. Rebecca does not suggest following a BDUF model, but taking decisions at the right moment and sharing expectations of when we need to make these decisions; they should be so late that we have information for making decisions, or so far ahead that they interfere with deliveries.

Evolutionary architecture is the basis for this moment, because only then can we replace parts in the moment they were correct.

The fifth point is continuous delivery (continuous delivery), namely having the source code always ready to be delivered and thrown into production. To do this, we need to make sure that deliveries are smaller and more constant, so we won't have big impacts on training and learning; learning a little bit at a time is much more efficient and profitable than all at once.

After that, we need to automate everything, all levels of testing, building (build) and deployment (deploy), but this doesn't mean it has to be done always alone, for Rebecca there's a big red button when pressed puts the code into production without infringing on the notion, definition or objective of constant delivery. We can't forget that we need to keep risk under control, and for Rebecca this means a safety net, which sends us quickly forward but returns as quickly as possible to the last stable version.

The sixth point starts to involve members of the Design team, and this needs to be fully aligned with continuous creation (Continuos Design) and transformation of the way we interact and treat user experience (UX), we need to think, create, publish, and unpublished our assumptions as soon as possible and as much as possible.

When we have all these points aligned and resolved, we fall into a dilemma, because cost forecast is related to stability, and changing even orderly is not always efficient. Each company has its point of balance like its main source of profit. Then we need to find this point and separate them into deliverable activities and valued at their measure.

A good move may be the start of portfolio management work, where each block has its value and can be weighed, measured, and prioritized.

Thus with truly adaptable systems that have less cost and risk, so that the product team can experiment showing how we are with feedback, probably we will achieve better results that serve the entire organization.
