I didn't expect this could happen so soon, as the academic flow usually takes much longer and tends to bypass more experienced individuals. But it happens that in 2010 my family will get a new professor.
I've always had this dream, just like my family, to one day teach and maybe help build the foundations of some careers, just as I'm used to hearing great people referring to my mother; or maybe receive unconditional affection from students... materialized in chocolates, apples, and other things... just like my older sister.
I'm off then!!! I believe the time has come! From February 22nd onwards, after participating in a selection process, I'll be teaching alongside fifth-year students at the University of Potiguar (UnP) on Software Engineering. As a laureate graduate student and a post-graduate student, seeing many excellent professionals returning to classrooms to contribute to the academic community, I'm proud to say that it's my turn!
I've been specializing in this subject for some time; as a good agileist, I've been working hard to build software with quality and focused on a big ROI upfront, influencing and being influenced by teams wherever I go; I hope to bring some of this to the classes and together with students build new and excellent systems, driving stakes and raising walls in real practices that will make a difference in everyday life for the community and market.
Another professor in the family... I hope to live up to my old surname and the new one!!
