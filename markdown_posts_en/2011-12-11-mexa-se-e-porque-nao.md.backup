Recent participation in Desconf 2011, as well as conversations and recent events, made me reflect on our behavior as agents of change in our work environment. Many times we hear or start debates with the phrase "this would never work where I work", but you'll never be certain until you try.

A year ago I tweeted happily that I was leaving Natal to face new tasks, meet new people, immerse myself in new domains and face changes openly. What didn't sound strange at the time, despite being warned by GLeydson Lima, but which makes perfect sense now is my position on all of this. I believe that everyone has already gone or will go through a situation like this, where they put themselves smaller to the challenge with only one perspective, that it will absolve much more just by standing in a passive learning position. It happens that things are not always as we imagine and being surprised while learning, speaking or simply helping has been excellent.

This year I had the pleasure of participating in various events and listening to many good and intelligent people, @dwildt, @brunopedroso, @alegomes, @rwilli, @andrefaria, @joaostein, @julioprotzek, @miprotzek, @fkenjikamei, @lcparzianello, @manoelp, @rafb3, @hugocorbucci, @dtsato, @nukdf, @paulocaroli, @rafajagua and @thiagoesser, all sharing only the will to learn. I participated in my first big event, Agile Brazil 2011, and also in the more innovative Desconf 2011, and took part in the first steps of a new group, learning much through successes and mistakes.

In the last two weeks, I've been moving around a lot to help continue changing at Stefanini OpenTalks. We need to think about change and how we can make ourselves do what we expect others to do if we don't improve.

Through the places I've passed by, I see that any team is capable and should fight to establish not just professional but also friendly and committed relationships over intellectual growth among colleagues, mutual growth. I've worked in a large team, and each day that passes takes us another step towards the direction we were looking for when we came here, but I'm still surprised at how it can be even better to be an active part of transformation. Last week I transmitted this idea to the new members of Stefanini, and hope that 2012 will come with more personality, open talks, study groups and much learning. As Rafael Bandeira said... there's a lot of off-line experience waiting for us!!
