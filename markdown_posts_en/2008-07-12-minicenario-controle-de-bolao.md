Continuing the session, let's move on to the second Minicen√°rio.

Jairo works in the Department of Informatics at a large company. He and his friends are always creating pools for MegaSena, Quina, and other types of games. Jairo always controls the numbers bet and the people who joined the pool, their emails (to receive the bet numbers) and whether they paid their shares. However, this has been taking up a considerable amount of time. Therefore, he thought about developing an application that meets the following functional requirements:
- Allow participants to be registered for each pool, with their nicknames and emails;
- For each made pool, register the share value, number of shares, the cards bet (with their corresponding numbers), the game type (MegaSena, Quina etc.), the contest number, and the date when the draw will take place;
- Control who paid for each share;
- Automatically generate a web page with the drawing data, pool participants with their shares, and the numbers bet. The HTML file of this page will be sent via email;
- Each participant can purchase more than one share;
- Generate a list of participants who have not yet paid;
- The application must verify if the total of the shares is equal to the total bet;
- A certain bet can be used in other pools.
Consider that all operations are performed by Jairo, who can be identified as Pool Manager.
