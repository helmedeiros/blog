Agile Brazil 2010 started today!
As with any great event featuring excellent speakers, Agile Brazil began for me some time ago with the publication of the program, which was supposed to help us with its tracks related to familiarity and expertise among participants... but it didn't help me much!! It happens that in our scenario, where large masses of information are released on blogs without concrete functionality, good talks, even basic ones, are always desirable; delivered in capable hands, 45 minutes can take your floor away and build something entirely new, and that's what I expect from Agile Brazil 2010. At this moment, the experience and openness of speakers will make all the difference.

I saw an unconventional format that caught my attention, and with some contacts, I chose the first course I was going to participate in at the event. Good grade, good instructors, and many of them invited me to bring my notebook because we would implement something in an extreme universe... it could only be very interesting.

The Introduction to Extreme Programming course started at 10:00 am on June 22nd with Bruno Pedroso, Dairton Bassi, Daniel Wildt, Giovanni Bassi, Hugo Corbucci, and Renato Willi telling a bit about their career trajectories. At this point, an element emerged that would be part of most of the event - the POMODOR TIMER. As there was a vast subject to be explored and even more baggage of examples, cases, and other things from our domain's 6 instructors, but there was a path to follow to achieve all the expected content; tomatoes were defined for each theme, and each one went their way until the same sound rang out for the first time, and we began our immersion in XP.

Our second tomato raised the group's expectations for the course. At this moment, an open space was created so that everyone could transfer to their post-its, which would later be grouped by similarities and defended before the team regarding how they would be addressed and at what level.

The third tomato focused on presenting chaos reports and how XP works with team cultures to focus on the software parcel that will actually be used. In this context, Daniel put an interesting example that removed some misunderstanding about the first version of XP, which treated code above people and respect. Agility and XP expect simplicity, but also respect, and the combination of these is counterproductive because you won't create something so simple that disrespects your team, software, and client. "Simplicity is the art of maximizing what's not done." Removing fat is desirable, but the product must get respect from everyone, including yours!

Some consecutive tomatoes explored history, XP life cycle, principles, values, and practices, and at the end, a theoretical and cultural practice focused on relationships and applying learned concepts was held to create an ATM. As usual, several teams failed in execution, with part of the team involved in practices and others not, something very common in our daily lives.

At the end of the afternoon, a paired development session took place over a simple numeric conversion problem for writing numbers in English, conducted by groups.

XP - Agile Brazil 2010
The course was a continuous learning experience that led us to have more ATTITUDE, strengthen our COMMUNICATION by working as a TEAM and continuously improving!! Worth it!!
