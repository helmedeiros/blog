Imbertti started talking about why agile, for him one of the things is to discover the product and meet the market; another point is to work together and debate the issues.

Story Mapping is developing the product in layers, where the lowest layer of a cake can still be achieved with a party, the more you learn and evolve the cake gains layers and can get better.

Baby.com.br entered the Brazilian market in 2012 using an existing platform to deliver as soon as possible. After some time, growth was restricted and they started investing in their own platform after validating their business model.

In this scenario Imbertti embarked on the baby adventure and began sharing his knowledge and defending his method. The team was distributed and needed to hold their breath for BO that wrote several functionalities per minute on Basecamp.

This is how Story mapping was introduced, involving everyone. Each functionality is described, prioritized, and defined as important for a specific user.

First, the backbone of the product was written, defining from preparation to purchase to delivery, customer service, and coverage of the service, with final analysis by the team. These items are positioned at the top to guide where each story or task is.

The group started creating and presenting various tasks, at this moment the fear of agile teams may increase, or even motivation may decrease. There were many commercial restrictions, marketing restrictions, among other specialties.

What problem, how to make it happen? Who should be heard? The MOTHER for sureâ€¦ Many restrictions were made, and the team started working on streamlining everything! Efficiency was maximized in the developed. Stories were ripped apart, and through constant delivery and learning, they evolved and trusted the rhythm.

Deployment triggers, functionalities were pulled! Mother says what's needed. The goal is to get the product home with mom, all technical parts for launch tested and tested, and now evolved!

Restrictions inspire creativity, value by the client's perspective and seek to validate assumptions!
