Below is the second lesson taught in the software engineering discipline at UnP. Anyone with some tips or suggestions are still very welcome. We had a brief passage through the history of software creation today, we talked about the "software crisis" that despite being dated from a long time ago, still does not show evidence of correction for all factors that influenced it.

A project's software components were presented and we discussed some scenarios and what influence each of these has on the final result, success or failure in the project. We saw software engineering concepts and their need to guide through techniques for quality software with repeatable deliveries that meet needs but cost little or are interesting comparing cost and ROI.
