The keynote speaker started presenting himself as unworthy of being the keynote for this great event, and defining everyone else involved in the community's growth. To him, it's not just about electing a committee to represent and fight for everyone's interests when many voices are clamoring at the same time.

Agile Brazil has been doing well, and that happens when the group's interest represents its members! However, in many cases, it seems like our political representatives are prioritizing their own interests above those of their constituents.

For Alê, what we're living through in Brazilian politics is all connected to what we're seeking in Agile Brazil - government delivers value to the people and the people give feedback to the client; agile methods aim for that, where the team delivers value to the client and the client gives feedbacks to the team so that they can continue iteratively improving.

Agile methods aim for short feedback cycles, and we know the benefits of that. When thinking about politics, however, with 4-year cycles, we have desires and in the end, there's a huge distance between those. If agile practitioners were consulted to fix this problem, we would have shorter cycles, daily meetings, pulled systems, and constant feedbacks - but we're not seeing that happen in public administration.

Alê invited everyone to participate in social control mass now, because only with everyone's participation and constant feedback can we provide improvements.

We should always keep Ash Maurya's premise high: "Life is too short to create something nobody wants." The high-level government administration of public institutions didn't create any motivation or relationship with the business area - that has changed. The TCU made a ruling in 2010 (2308⁄2010-TCU-Plenario). They're now forcing changes, defining that all objectives must be accompanied and measured, and these ideas are common... aren't they?

The problem seems to be not spending money but how it's being used. If we find that agile practices can improve our government, the question is: will the government be able to have the client along? Alê thought Brazil's inertia wouldn't promote this change until the last month.

There are now large initiatives, such as comment press, which facilitates discussion about Brazilian issues; where my money went, which says where the largest part of your money goes; where my vote went, which tells what were the main efforts of politicians; deputies analytics, which brings information on parliamentary presence and other things; take care of my neighborhood, so people can report problems in their neighborhood like potholes, burned traffic lights; open cup, which allows data tracking of Copa financing; and many more apps with some or several public data. And these social control forms tend to position clients closer to the government.

There is currently this desire for change, this interest that feedback cycles should be shortened so we can exercise our citizenship even more. Alê proposes going to regional and global webs, to streets and squares, to fight or instigate changes and the future we want to exist. The digital citizen, which focuses on allowing project law subscriptions through electronic signatures, pl 6928⁄2002 and prc 68⁄2011 try to give legitimacy to the digital, so that these voices can be heard, and then changes are possible.

The problem we face today in public administration is the same one we've lived with for years in software projects - and just like in agile methods, we need to leave the buildings, discover who the groups and clients are through customer discovery, and work in their favor. Estonia is doing this; the state wants to be the facilitator of the people; they're saying that solutions outside public offices can be better than internal ones.

The biggest problem in Brazil isn't technological - being waterfall or not, using Java or Ruby; it's not how we hire people; it's what software should be made. We need to think about Agile Brazil beyond just making things happen! So Alê adds that more than having functioning software, we must have the right software!!
