These days I received an intriguing message sent by a software engineering student from another university:
> "It was mentioned in my software engineering class about an element that I didn't understand very well, something that's cited in some engineering books, called 'the masked man' or 'man of the mask', and I'd like to know what role it plays in software engineering and where I can find more about this".

When I read this message, I immediately thought it was someone trying to make a joke. I had to assume I didn't have enough knowledge to respond, and since there are so many buzzwords in our profession with little-used translations that made me discard any possibility of being true the questions about any role or practice involving a "masked man" or "man of the mask", along with the scope of software engineering.

The term Masked Man, used by designer B. C. Boyer in the 80s for a masked character who fought crime, was used again a decade later in Steve McConnell's paper Tool Support for Project Tracking in the IEEE Software magazine column Best Practices written monthly by Steve McConnell, author of the book Code Complete.

According to Steve, it is essential to follow project plans and schedules in real-time; if you don't do this as a member of an auto-managed team or a project manager, you may fail. Within this context, it presents good practices, features of some modern software like "The Masked Man" or "Masked Man". This technological strategy offers a form of impartial and anonymous reporting within projects. Unlike the bearer of bad news, who can be in some way penalized, for this is recommended the use of electronic bulletin boards with anonymous posting visible throughout the company, where any employee could highlight individual or collective problems.

> "If developers are turning their code over to testing later than scheduled, a concerned tester can report that. If testers are releasing builds to documentation that have not been well tested, a concerned technical writer can report that. If a project manager is exaggerating the project's progress in reports to upper management, a concerned developer can report that".

Current methodologies, mainly agile ones, define good communication as essential to a project's success; the Agile Manifesto defines individuals and their interactions above processes and tools, and this is what I see failing the Masked Man concept - bureaucratization and impersonality of feedback work as command control, generating more discomfort within the team than improvements.

According to Kent Beck, in his book Extreme Programming Explained, when we analyze problems that occur in projects, we see many of them were caused by someone who didn't talk to someone else about something important. This poor communication doesn't happen by chance, and it's at this point that practices like the one proposed by Steve McConnell emerge, tending to distance team members and delaying feedback - a programmer shouldn't be punished by his manager or colleague for presenting bad news.

Corrections on the project path should always be made, and as many honest, frank, and timely information as possible received. Then, before we make our company's coexistence even more complicated with anti-productive practices, we must strive to cultivate and promote practices that strengthen commitment and impartiality in our teams and projects. Before our team starts dusting off their resumes, we should encourage practices like those reinforced by Esther Derby and Diana Larsen, in Agile Retrospectives - strategies are found in everyday life and can be reinforced cycle after cycle, adapting personal decisions or outcomes impersonally. Above all, we are a team.
