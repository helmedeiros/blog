After following Phillip's blog for several years, I finally attended the WS-46 course at Caelum Rio on this Monday. In a recent post and during our conversations during breaks, Phillip said that this would probably be the last year of the course... I'm very happy to have taken the opportunity.
The course started at 09:20h due to some Apple Mini Display Port -> Projector connection issues with VGA input. Nico Steppat, who was there, quickly provided a notebook to replace Phillip's Mac Pro, and the lecture began with the warning that the computer didn't belong to him and would surely have problems…. modesty aside, the course was very good.
Coming from Natal/RN, I was impressed by the number of .NET developers interested in DDD. This type of course back home would certainly be dominated by Rails and Java developers.
We had 17 students divided into 4 groups for a meticulous accompaniment by the instructor, creating a domain model based on user stories presented for a parking lot.
The course was held over three modules, with the first two being morning sessions starting at 09:20h and ending at 13:00h. In the first part, Phillip covered the necessary decisions to be made when initially encountering an application, which he divided into three questions: What, How, and What. The second part discussed languages and how it's important to speak the same language during project development, avoiding the creation or proliferation of technical or semantic noise.
We all went out for lunch nearby, and as with any good geek gathering, we exchanged ideas and experiences... in those hours, there's no online course that compares !!!
We returned to Caelum at 14:00h, and with various practices, we learned some patterns and techniques that help us use a single language in our projects.
So here's my personal tip: tomorrow will be the last day of courses with Phillip at Caelum. He'll still be in Brazil for some time. And judging by today's discussions, I can say that this guy is very tough !!! And he's far from those snobbish stars we run into out there !!!
Thanks, Phillip, and thanks, Caelum.
