October 22 and 23, the 11th scientific congress will roll at Universidade Potiguar - RN.
I was invited by the course direction for systems of information to give a mini-course SCRUM on transforming teams into high-value delivery teams in eight hours.
As a student, I attended some of these congresses, listening to lectures from my current supervisor Prof. Paulo Benício about Open-GL programming. Those congresses were excellent, and I hope this year will be even better!
Programming has changed a lot since then, with more up-to-date topics. In any case, you shouldn't miss it! See you there!
