First lesson on XP agile methodology taught at Universidade Potiguar. In this class, flaws were presented in other methodologies, including agile ones, regarding lack of attention to internal project quality, which reinforces, according to Martin Fowler in Scrum Flácido, the need for methodologies focused on technical practices that remove and do not add technical debt. Also presented are problems found in software environments and XP's solutions to the same. Finally, values that guide the methodology are highlighted.
