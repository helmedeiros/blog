What is continuous delivery (Continuous Delivery – CD)? Let's start the presentation! As Jenny and Danilo continued to chat, we saw what was next, principles of analysis and engineering involved, definitions, and finally principles and activities that can be used and tested to really move forward with this practice, advancing consciously our deliveries continuously throughout their days and sprints.

Continuous delivery is a software development strategy that optimizes its delivery process to obtain high-quality software, delivered as quickly as possible, but more incredible than it seems, just like most strategies we read, we end up prioritizing practices and steps instead of why. For Danilo, it's noticeable that the manuals and blogs that talk about CD predominate, an engineering approach only in terms of technology with tips and step-by-step instructions that leave aside questions of analysis, product, and mainly value related to delivery, and that is exactly where agile analysis enters the topic we need to reflect on.

First, because we need CD, secondly, according to Danilo, despite breaking common thought, working collaboration between analysts and designs, faster iterations, continuous feedback among others through agile, there is still much work to be done until we really deliver something in production, which still takes us a long time to get there. Then enters CD and accumulates technical aspects, you automate everything and it's okay? Are we delivering the right thing faster? It doesn't matter if we deliver faster, working on building feedback cycles unless we work on rapid growth value. Then CD is not just about delivering, this is not the goal and should be to deliver the correct thing faster, reduce risks, and really conclude what was started. Based on that, some principles were presented that need to be considered in the path to Continuous Delivery.

Principles:
#1 – Thinking beyond the software in operation, we have, thinking about the objective, who is the public to which the software is intended, what are the qualitative criteria that will be considered on the CD path.
#2 – Small and incremental steps.
#3 – Ongoing product management, we cannot see the work as completed when delivering the product, there are many other processes that advance beyond the engineering and development of the product. We need to continue collecting in subsequent phases like sales numbers from the commercial team among others to know when the product is really concluding.
#4 – Plan for the retirement of functionalities in your system, we need to continue analyzing and removing unnecessary features, it doesn't matter if we deliver, monitor, and don't go back, removing what's not wanted.
#5 – Delivering VALUE is not equal to having something complete, evolving can be a very valuable thing for your public.

How can we make this practical?
First, it was suggested that we maintain our backlogs, what's the essence of each assumption behind each item existing there. Manage and see why we're leaving something for later may indicate something? Finally, we need to "prune, not sweep" our backlog.
Thirdly, add feedback to each feature as you expect it, and add it to your feature as one, it will prove the feature in the end more efficient. They should not be generic tools with vanity metrics, but feedbacks that are visible, validatable, and representative of what is expected in terms of action and reaction.
Finally, a new approach was suggested, with less work being done in large packages (BDUF) with epic assumptions without validation, user research, guerrilla testing, test analysis, and much collaboration, this way we will have the delivery of a more relevant product and with more sense to what the products should be delivered quickly in terms of success, continuously delivering what is desired! Or learn and get there as soon as possible!
