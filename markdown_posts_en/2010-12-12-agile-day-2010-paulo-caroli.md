**Agile: Unlocking our Human Potential - Patrick Kua**

The presentation by Paulo Caroli started with a review of the importance of understanding our own human potential. He emphasized that agility is not just about adopting new methodologies, but also about recognizing and leveraging our individual strengths and weaknesses.

**AgileBR Welcome!!**

Paulo then introduced himself as a representative of AgileBR, a Brazilian community focused on agile practices.

**Linha de Montagem de Software (Software Assembly Line)**

He presented his talk on "Software Assembly Line" (Linha de Montagem de Software), which aimed to explore the concept of using card walls to visualize and manage software development projects.

**Card Walls**

Paulo explained that card walls are a simple, visual representation of workflow, allowing teams to track progress and identify bottlenecks. He demonstrated how card walls can be used to:

1. Prioritize tasks based on their importance
2. Identify waiting stages (Waiting stages) and action stages (Action stages)
3. Monitor throughput (Vazão), bandwidth (Banda larga), and latency (Latência)

**Limites (Limits)**

Paulo emphasized the importance of setting limits in card walls to ensure that teams stay focused and avoid overcommitting.

**User Stories**

He highlighted the need for granularity in user stories, breaking them down into smaller tasks (Tarefas) to facilitate better estimation and prioritization.

**Bugs (Defects)**

Paulo stressed the importance of tracking defects (BUGS) and prioritizing their fixing. He demonstrated how card walls can help teams identify and address bugs more effectively.

**Presentation Conclusion**

The presentation concluded with a Q&A session, during which Paulo encouraged attendees to adapt and refine their own card walls based on their specific needs and experiences.
