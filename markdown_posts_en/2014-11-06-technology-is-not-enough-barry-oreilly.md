During the years companies appear and disappear with a certain frequency, and not just small ones have disappeared but many large ones have failed. Where did the ideas go? What happened to the market? Are we doing the right thing? Are we trying to control the uncontrollable, the unpredictable?

Many of these companies that went out of business are built on deep and verticalized organizations. How can we work in the unpredictable when decisions only give us small waterfalls!

Information and ideas flow through networks, where each person is a sensor. And so that we can take advantage of this, we need different organizational structures.

The first step is to make companies and their structures more transparent. Imagine if your structure were transparent like a melon. You see it green until you open it and it's red.

But leading networked structures is very difficult for managers who only work in predictive systems. We need change and work with the principle of missions, think about goals and enable autonomy to achieve them.

For a long time companies have created a culture of meritocracy based on deliverables and rejecting errors. But if we don't master, autonomy, and purpose, we'll never reach real potentialized by the network.

The second step must be to start listening and valuing user information, there are many great things being created without user testing, without experimentation, without metrics, things created in secret and launched into the darkness that can't be found or seen. We can't delay, nor slow down delivery speed, we need to get out and see for ourselves.

The third step is to feel comfortable with all the uncertainty that exists, we have to know that everything around us influences our success, as much as your feedback allows you to perceive!
