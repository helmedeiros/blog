I Felt Before the End of the World
It happened on December 17, 2012, at the third edition of the rapid unconference (#desconf2012) in Porto Alegre. This year, it was organized only by Daniel Wildt and Natalia Arsand, and the event was spectacular, just like the others, but in a more concise format with approximately 28 participants, including 20 speakers and 8 presenters.
Considering an event completely outside the standards of desconf, as I had mentioned before, it has a very streamlined format that maximizes the first contact between interested parties on a subject; or even guarantees the creation of new ideas based on metaphors extracted. Speakers with their 5-minute insights, and presenters with enormous interests in learning and sharing, magic happens in less than 2 hours.
This year's event took place inside TecnoPUC at ASSESPRO-RS Auditorium (Building 96D). As the central point, I hoped we would have more people to exchange ideas than last year, but ultimately, there was nothing to complain about; the presented ideas were just as good.

The event began at 19:00h, with an open coffee break in the auditorium itself, a great strategy to familiarize presenters with the location where we would spend the next 2 hours (or 3 hours) exchanging many ideas.

At 20:00h, Daniel gave the starting signal with a fast talk that, in less than 5 minutes, introduced new unconference attendees to the history and dynamics of the event; basically, we didn't have an order for presentations, each speaker felt affinity between subjects and presented themselves as candidates for the next presentation.

Desconf 2012 – TweetRoulette
The first to volunteer this year was Mauricio Wolff, who followed one of the desconf's trending topics by presenting a new product for tweet lottery, Tweet Roulette. The presentation was very well done, and the product was quite interesting. There were also other interesting products, such as the Smile Flame Project, an idea that has been tested and pivoted by Daniel Mattos.

Choose what makes you happy and trade it in for a smile.
Other presentations I found very cool were:
- Thiago Esser on "Content Strategy";
- Daniel Wildt on "Finding the path to professional success through self-knowledge";
- Rafael Helm on "Digital Marketing".
I presented "Success in Measure – Vanity Metrics," which told a little about the relationships between analysis, strategy, and metrics, easily and constantly masked to present success or trend.

That's it! I hope 2013 will bring more ideas and surprises, and certainly another desconf!!!
