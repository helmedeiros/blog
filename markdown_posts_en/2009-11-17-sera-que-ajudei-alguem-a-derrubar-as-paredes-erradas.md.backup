About a month ago, I conducted a mini-course on agile methodologies and Scrum together with my former colleague and friend Germano Carvalho at the 11th scientific congress of UnP. At first, we were concerned about the number of participants and their interest in the subject. I imagined the room would be half full, but it turned out that Germano was spot on. I think the participants had already read many articles and ended up prolonging their holidays.

We couldn't lead the mini-course in a proper way, as there were not enough students. Apparently, the event had some issues with promotion, and we ended up reinforcing four friendships and meeting two new acquaintances.

I believe we could share a little of our experience implementing and using agile methodologies with the event participants, preventing them from going out there knocking down wrong walls.

I've been exchanging recent stories with people in the field and think it's very valuable to learn about these agile frameworks or even coachings during one's learning process.

Below are the presentation slides for those interested.
