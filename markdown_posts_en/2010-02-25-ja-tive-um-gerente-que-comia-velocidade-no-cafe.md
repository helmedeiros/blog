There's a good while I've been observing the most diverse forms used by team managers where I passed to carry out my productivity tracking and also for others to estimate theirs. Some take their time analyzing mysterious function points, others just look at code lines and only a few, perhaps the most interesting ones, see the quantity of delivered features that really satisfied our client iteration after iteration.

In Scrum, there's an interesting concept to help teams with their estimates, abstracting away complex and elaborate forecasting practices used by many teams, requiring a bit more interaction between developers and clients. The planning poker is made from experiences, communication, and why not a little fun to define how complex something can be. This metric associated with our team's velocity helps us say how much software we can deliver to the client.

I've seen satisfied clients several times, those who cross the street without needing to change sidewalks, and even with deliveries repeating iteration after iteration, my manager was still eating away at our velocity early in the morning, over coffee.

Apparently, it didn't matter if there was success; as long as there was space to push more tasks, that's exactly what he wanted. Knowing your team's ideal speed and how much you can work with it is really a gift. I don't need to say that when pressure increases, a team can really switch gears, and where estimating was fun, it becomes a little game of justifying why you're not increasing velocity day after day.

Just looking at numbers and graphs sometimes makes you lose sight of what's most important: always delivering more and more product that the client needs!!
