The last scenario among proposed items follows a business rule.
Bruno and his father bought a plot of land and opened a parking lot.
To help, Bruno's sister is developing an application for parking control.
When a vehicle enters the parking lot, the attendant observes its plate and it is registered along with the vehicle model and color.
The entry time is generated automatically, corresponding to the moment of plate registration.

After parking the vehicle, the customer takes the ticket where it is printed: the license plate number, vehicle model, color, entry date, and time.
Upon returning to the parking lot, the customer delivers the ticket. The stay duration is calculated. Considering this stay duration, the price table is applied, knowing that the Saturday schedule is not the same as weekdays and sometimes, depending on the year of the season, owners launch promotions during weekdays.
