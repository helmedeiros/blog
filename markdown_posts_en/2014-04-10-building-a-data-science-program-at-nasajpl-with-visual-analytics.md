Exploring the universe generates an enormous amount of data. And when we're talking about the data that faces us all the time, we're talking about a set of satellites processing and sending data day and night throughout the day.
Data exchange technologies as well as their sources are getting larger and more diverse, data exchange by lasers is almost happening, and how can we look at these data up close? What mysteries exist in them? We need to process them quickly to understand what we're observing but don't understand.
Just like _dark matter, _Rob Witoff proposes that the information we collect is actually dark data until we can extract all the hidden or obscured information from so many data.
NASA has been working for a long time extracting/capturing data and transforming it into power in the hands of specialists so we can make decisions faster.
According to Harvard Business Review Data Scientist, it's the most sexy job of the 21st century. The role of _Data Scientist is first to facilitate the release of data and provide sharing so that through collaboration a set of unimaginable force can be created around a set of data that allows us to process and extract the sense from our dark data.
Today it's much simpler to work with large amounts of data than it was before, we have many services on demand, we have strong integration between professionals and amateurs (Pro-Am), which can drive the discovery of information. So sharing is very necessary.
Next the Data Scientist should be guided by the idea of propelling/facilitating specialists in discovering and making decisions about real data. First asking questions to specialists, working with data and bringing it back again so they can look, see, search and fail as quickly as possible, iterating over masses and more masses of data.
There are today a set of simple tools that facilitate the extraction of information within our dark data, and once we have it, we can plot it and make it simpler for specialists to manipulate and follow at any moment.
Next the Data Scientist should infuse all knowledge so that other people can discover and analyze information, manipulating it in the best possible way.
The Data Scientist should take knowledge to a larger number of people, so they can transform it. Inside NASA they have some programs that allow scientists, startups and others to immerse themselves in data and information and finally share them with specialists who will validate them and eventually generate more knowledge for the public.
Showing information in a different way is generating an increasingly greater value about discoveries made by NASA, because we cannot release our company's data, empower the community and specialists with not just data but also information and help the community to transform it, so Rob Witoff's presentation ended.
