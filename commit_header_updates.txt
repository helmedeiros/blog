with the main portal at heliomedeiros.com:

- Fixed header overlay issue with proper body padding (70px desktop, 60px mobile)
- Added smooth hover transitions and professional spacing
- Implemented mobile-responsive design with touch-friendly elements

### Navigation Logic
- Local links for blog-specific content (Posts)

## Technical Improvements

- Fixed navbar fixed-top positioning with proper content spacing
