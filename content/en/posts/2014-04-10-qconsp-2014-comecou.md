QCon São Paulo 2014
In its 5th edition, Qcon starts in São Paulo at WTC, with a new location, new infrastructure, and larger intervals for networking. This year's sponsor tracks will be separate and named as solution tracks to provide transparency on what to expect.
QconSP has 6 tracks, with specific programming available at http://qconsp.com/schedule.
1. Big Data, Data Science, and the Power of Data
2. Performance and Scalability in Practice
3. Front-end universe: JS, HTML5, and new frontiers of UX
4. Java on the Cutting Edge
5. Architectures You Always Wanted to Know
6. Dynamics and Functionals: Languages and Techniques for the Polyglot Dev
7. Frontiers of Development
8. Mobile: Portable and Furious
9. Creating Cultures and Teams that Work
10. From Projects to Products: DevOps, Continuous Delivery, and Beyond
