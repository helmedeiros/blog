Yesterday I attended Caelum Day here in Rio, and I'm still excited about everything I saw. Kicking off this series of recaps with one of the most eye-opening talks of the day: **Fábio Kung's presentation on cloud computing**.

## When "Cloud" Was Still a New Concept

For someone like me, who had only worked at local companies where everything was hosted **on physical servers in the office** or on **traditional web hosting providers**, hearing Kung talk about cloud computing felt like getting a glimpse of the future.

He works at **Locaweb**, which is already a big name in hosting in Brazil, and he shared how they're starting to move toward a new infrastructure model where **you no longer need to know which machine your code is running on**. That blew my mind.

## What Stood Out to Me

- The ability to **scale automatically**: if your system starts getting more traffic, new instances spin up. When it slows down, they go away. You only pay for what you use.
- The idea that **developers can provision resources without relying on an "infrastructure team."**
- And most impressive: how fast you can **deploy new versions** — no need to request server access or port releases.

## First Time Hearing "Infrastructure as Code"

He also mentioned tools like Puppet that let you **automate server configuration**. That was totally outside my day-to-day, but made perfect sense when he explained how it avoids manual errors and makes environments reproducible.

## Left the Room Thinking

I'd never considered that one day I could launch an entire system without touching a physical server. It still feels a bit abstract, but I left with my head full of ideas. It made me want to dig deeper, test things out, and figure out how this could apply to real-world projects.

## Conclusion

If you're still living in the world of FTP and shared hosting like I was, you'll definitely get a lot out of it.

**Next up in this series** — a post about the new VRaptor 3!
