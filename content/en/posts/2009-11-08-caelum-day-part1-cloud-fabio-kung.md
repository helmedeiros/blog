> **Series: Caelum Day 2009** | **Part 1 of 7** > _Comprehensive coverage of cutting-edge talks from Rio's premier Java event_

**Starting our series**, I want to share my impressions from **Fábio Kung's** presentation on **Cloud Computing**. Back in 2009, "the cloud" was still an emerging concept, and Fábio's insights from his work at Locaweb provided a glimpse into what would become the standard way of thinking about infrastructure.

## The Context at the Time

It's important to remember that in 2009, most companies were still managing their own physical servers. **Amazon EC2** had launched just three years earlier, and concepts like "Infrastructure as Code" were mostly theoretical.

Fábio talked about **Locaweb's** experience with cloud infrastructure and how they were already experimenting with virtualization and dynamic resource allocation.

## Key Insights from the Talk

What struck me most was how Fábio framed cloud computing not just as "renting servers," but as a **fundamental shift in how we think about infrastructure**:

- **Elasticity**: Resources that scale up and down based on demand
- **Pay-per-use**: Only paying for what you actually consume
- **Automation**: Infrastructure managed through code and APIs
- **Geographic distribution**: Deploying closer to users worldwide

## Locaweb's Practical Experience

Fábio shared real examples from Locaweb's infrastructure:

- How they handled traffic spikes during major events
- The challenges of **migrating from physical to virtual** infrastructure
- **Cost comparisons** between traditional hosting and cloud services
- Early experiments with **automated deployment**

## What Resonated with Me

- The idea that **infrastructure could be versioned and replicated** like code
- That geographic distribution wasn't just for large corporations anymore
- The prediction that **manual server management** would become obsolete

## YouTube Reference

For those interested in the original content, there's a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example) from one of Fábio's similar presentations on cloud computing and infrastructure evolution.

## Looking Back from Today

Writing this in 2009, these concepts seemed revolutionary. Today, Infrastructure as Code, auto-scaling, and cloud-first architecture are standard practices. Fábio's talk was a preview of the transformation that was coming.
