Approximately a month ago, I conducted a mini-course together with my former colleague and friend Germano Carvalho on <a title="Congresso Cientifico" href="/?p=49" target="_self">metodologias ágeis e scrum</a> at the 11th scientific congress of UnP.

Initially, we were concerned about the number of participants and their interest in the subject.

I had imagined a half-full room, but in the end, Germano was spot on.

I think the participants had already read many articles and ended up prolonging their holidays.

We couldn't lead the mini-course in an appropriate manner, as there was a lack of students.

Apparently, the event had some problems with promotion, and we ended up reinforcing four friendships and getting to know two new faces.

I believe that we were able to share a bit of our experience, implementing and using agile methodologies, with the participants at the event, preventing them from leaving without <a title="Fragmental" href="http://blog.fragmental.com.br/2009/11/14/derrubaram-as-paredes-erradas/" target="_blank">derrubando paredes erradas</a>.

I've been exchanging recent updates with some people in the field and I think it's very valuable to learn about agile frameworks or even coaching during their learning process.

Below are the presentation slides for those interested: <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
