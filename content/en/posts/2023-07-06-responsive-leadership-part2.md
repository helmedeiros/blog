subtitle: Build coaching culture and psychological safety using GROW model, trust frameworks, and structured feedback techniques that transform team dynamics

## Creating a Coaching Culture

A responsive leader isn't just a decision-maker — they are a **coach, guide, and thought partner**. This part of the training focused on building a culture where coaching is not a title or a technique, but a daily behavior.

Creating a coaching culture means replacing directive habits with **curiosity, co-creation, and commitment to growth**. It means asking before telling, and listening to understand, not to reply.

```bash
# Simple prompt to build coaching habit
echo "Ask more than you answer." >> coaching_reminders.txt
```

## Cultivating a Culture of Trust

Trust is the bedrock of responsiveness. Without it, teams shrink into silence or surface-level compliance. With it, people take risks, ask hard questions, and build real progress.

We discussed **how trust is cultivated**: through consistency, transparency, and care. And how, as leaders, our micro-behaviors shape team trust every day.

### Performance vs. Trust Matrix

| High Performance | Low Performance |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| High Trust       | Top contributor | Learning teammate |
| Low Trust        | Liability       | Cultural risk     |

Trust **must never be sacrificed** for output. In the long run, performance cannot thrive without psychological safety.

## The Components of Trust

We broke trust into four actionable dimensions:

| Dimension   | Description                            | Practice to Build It                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Integrity   | Do you do what you say?                | Be consistent with commitments               |
| Competence  | Can people rely on your ability?       | Follow through, and ask for help when needed |
| Compassion  | Do others believe you care about them? | Be present and human in tough moments        |
| Reliability | Can people count on you consistently?  | Set realistic expectations and meet them     |

We also used a **trust self-assessment** to identify gaps and growth areas. It was a reminder that **trust isn't given or taken — it's earned through repeated behavior.**

## Psychological Safety

Psychological safety is **not about comfort — it's about permission**. Permission to speak up, disagree, try, and learn without fear of being punished or judged.

We reflected on how to create these conditions:

- Admit mistakes openly
- Invite dissent without punishment
- Celebrate learning behaviors (not just results)
- Circle back when someone takes a risk

```bash
# Weekly prompt to reinforce safety
echo "What did someone share this week that took courage?" >> safety_reflections.txt
```

## Coaching Techniques

Responsive leaders **use coaching as a primary leadership behavior**, not just in formal sessions.

### GROW Model

A structured conversation guide:

- **G**oal: What do you want?
- **R**eality: What's happening now?
- **O**ptions: What are the possibilities?
- **W**ay Forward: What will you do next?

This model helps keep coaching **focused, collaborative, and actionable**.

### The Coaching Spectrum (Push vs Pull)

We explored coaching styles as a spectrum:

| Pull (Empower)           | Push (Guide)              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Ask open questions       | Give suggestions          |
| Help co-create solutions | Offer your point of view  |
| Encourage reflection     | Set direction when needed |

Pull builds autonomy. Push provides clarity. **Balance is key.**

---

### Question Bank

We practiced using a variety of coaching questions:

| Situation                | Coaching Question                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Clarifying goals         | "What would success look like here?"    |
| Exploring obstacles      | "What's getting in the way right now?"  |
| Building ownership       | "What options do you see?"              |
| Accountability follow-up | "What's one step you're committing to?" |

```python
# Sample coaching journal entry
session = {
    "person": "Alex",
    "focus": "new role onboarding",
    "question": "What are you most curious — or nervous — about right now?"
}
print(session)
```

---

### STAR Model for Performance Conversations

To give feedback on performance with clarity and empathy, we used **STAR**:

- **Situation** – When and where?
- **Task** – What was the expectation?
- **Action** – What did the person do?
- **Result** – What was the outcome?

This format helps feedback land **factually and fairly**, reducing defensiveness and centering learning.

## The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

Finally, we revisited **Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions**, not as theory — but as a diagnostic and coaching lens:

| Dysfunction                 | Responsive Practice                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Absence of trust            | Create safety and model vulnerability    |
| Fear of conflict            | Normalize healthy disagreement           |
| Lack of commitment          | Clarify decisions and team ownership     |
| Avoidance of accountability | Make agreements explicit and mutual      |
| Inattention to results      | Align on shared goals, not personal wins |

A responsive leader sees dysfunction not as failure, but as **invitation to coach the system** — with courage, consistency, and care.

```bash
# Weekly team pulse
echo "What trust-building moment happened this week?" >> team_health_log.txt
```
