Last Saturday, May 15th, I attended a quick and quite interesting event called <a title="cafe ágil" href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/cafe-agil-em-recife" target="_blank">Café Ágil</a>.

This initiative by [ThoughtWorks Brazil][1] together with UFPE gathered three heavyweight speakers, Paulo Caroli (TW Br), Luiz Borba (Pitang) and Jim Webber (TW UK), and around 90 people at the Center for Informatics of UFPE, to discuss topics such XP, TDD, and Rest.

I met the SCRUM Paraíba folks face-to-face and had no idea about their existence until that moment.

We exchanged notes on the location of the most beautiful beaches, but under the influence of coffee, we ended up sharing various information about our cities' markets, living experiences, and visions on ideal leadership behavior in agile or non-agile environments.

Outside, as you would expect, there was a board with some topics that were chosen to be discussed during the roundtable at the end of the event.

I saw Camila Tartari (TW Br) exchanging pens for participation, and being a pen enthusiast myself, I took advantage of it to mark two themes that I found most interesting. **XP IS AGAINST DESIGN?** Paulo Caroli (@paulocaroli) started his presentation entitled <a title="O XP não é contra Design" href="http://www.slideshare.net/paulocaroli/cafe-agile-recife-xp-and-design-paulo-caroli-revisado" target="_blank">O XP não é contra Design</a> at 09:15h, apologizing for the loss of fluency in Portuguese, saying that nothing couldn't be corrected with time, and the Rio Janeiro accent was already coming back, so Portuguese would also return.

Immediately afterwards, we were led through his professional journey from his master's degree in OO and web development methodologies at PUC Rio to his great interest in design patterns and frameworks, until he bought Kent Beck's book _Extreme Programming Explained_ in

 2000.

Solely for the record, Paulo presented a project lifecycle within a traditional methodology, with phases of requirements gathering, analysis, design, coding, testing, and integration.

In this model, the functioning was a bit tumultuous, but there was a specific phase defined for design where decisions were made and consolidated in the analysis and design phases.

In an XP environment, however, does the design of architecture and its variations become comprehensible?

For Caroli, there is a division between architecture and design, with the former encompassing immediate decisions that would be costly to change in the future.

Therefore, one can understand the realization of an initial phase for architectural decisions and the parallel realization of various processes, with design entering here.

Design decisions occur all the time, considering only the latest <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/10/the-last-responsible-moment.html" target="_blank">momento oportuno para a decisão</a>.

XP is not against design and instead favors continuous improvement and evolution of design for better products and faster delivery. **TDD Direct from the Trenches** Luiz Borba started his presentation on the experience of implementing TDD at 10:20h.

The presentation was very interesting with many moments of relaxation.

Luiz is a manager at Pitang and participated in the implementation, which he said only occurred due to client demands for test-oriented development.

Who knows what TDD is?

That was the first question asked, accompanied by those who use it highlighting the need for discussion, according to Borba, many study but few convince themselves of its real efficiency.

Programmers like to develop and managers like to govern, and nobody likes to test.

TDD leaves developers programming tests, which is excellent.

According to Borba, one of the main problems in implementation is the cultural aspect of implementation; many times a developer gets used to testing, only to forget it quickly if no one reminds them and forces them to perform the tests.

Once the initial phase is overcome, a new problem arises; developers accustomed to testing become desperate when they don't have them in other projects. <a title="fotos Café Ágil" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heliomedeiros/sets/72157623961656217/with/4617934563/" target="_blank">Fotos do evento</a> Please note that I left all text exactly as written.
