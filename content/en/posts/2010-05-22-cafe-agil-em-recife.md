Last Saturday, May 15th, I was in Recife for a quick and interesting event, Café Ágil. This initiative of ThoughtWorks Brazil together with UFPE gathered three heavyweight speakers, Paulo Caroli (TW Br), Luiz Borba (Pitang) and Jim Webber (TW UK), and around 90 people at the Informatics Center's amphitheater, to discuss topics like XP, TDD, and Rest.

The event started at 8:30 am as befits a café and plenty of chat. I met SCRUM Paraíba folks and confessed I didn't know about the group until that moment.

We exchanged our cards on the most beautiful beaches, but under the coffee effect we exchanged various information on our cities' markets, our experience, and views on ideal leader and team behavior in agile or non-agile environments.

Outside, as there wouldn't be a shortage, we had a board with some topics to be chosen for discussion during the roundtable at the end of the event. I saw Camila Tartari (TW Br) trading pens for participation, and being a die-hard pen enthusiast, I marked two themes that seemed most interesting.

XP IS NOT AGAINST DESIGN?

Paulo Caroli (@paulocaroli) started his presentation entitled "XP is not against design" at 9:15 am, apologizing for the loss of fluency in Portuguese, saying that nothing can't be corrected with time, and the Rio accent would return soon, so Portuguese would too. Immediately after, we were taken on his professional trajectory from his master's degree in OO and methodologies for web development at PUC Rio to his great interest in design patterns and frameworks until he bought Kent Beck's book "Extreme Programming Explained" in 2000.

During this time abroad, Paulo referred to himself as an architect and questioned whether XP was really against design, with the passage of time he discovered it wasn't, and then started his actual presentation, outlining the agenda to be discussed.

In the 1990s, there were many methodology books, but they didn't have a clear design phase. In traditional methodologies, there's a specific and defined phase for design where decisions are made and consolidated in the analysis and design phases.

In an XP environment, what about architecture and design? For Caroli, there's a division between architecture and design; the first comprehends immediate decisions that must be taken and changes that would be costly. This way, one understands the realization of an initial phase for architectural decisions and parallel processes, with design entering in.

XP is not against design but rather favors continuous improvement and evolution of design for better products and earlier delivery.

TDD from the Trenches

Luiz Borba started his presentation on the experience of implementing TDD at 10:20 am. The presentation was very interesting with many relaxed moments. Luiz is a manager at Pitang and participated in the implementation, which, according to him, only occurred due to client demand for test-driven development.

Who knows what TDD is? It was the first question asked, accompanied by who uses it, highlighting the need for discussion; Borba said that many study but few convince themselves of its real efficiency. Programmers like to develop and managers like to govern, and nobody likes to test. TDD leaves developers programming tests, which is excellent.

According to Borba, one of the main problems in implementing TDD is the installation culture; many times a developer gets tired of testing and forgets quickly if no one reminds him or obliges him to perform the tests. Once past the initial phase, a new problem emerges; developers accustomed to testing get frustrated when they don't have it in other projects.
