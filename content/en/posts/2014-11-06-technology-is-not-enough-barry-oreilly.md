During the years, companies appear and disappear with a certain frequency, and not just small ones have disappeared, but many large ones have perished as well.

Where did the ideas go?

What happened to the market?

Are we doing the right thing?

Are we trying to control the uncontrollable and unpredictable?

A significant part of these companies that went extinct are based on deep and vertically organized structures.

How can we work in the unpredictable while decisions are only given by these large waterfall-style?

Information and ideas flow through networks, with each person being a sensor.

And so that we can take advantage of this, we need different organizational structures.

The first step is to make companies and their structures more transparent.

Imagine if your structure were as transparent as a watermelon.

You see it green until you open it, and then it's red.

But leading networked structures is very difficult for managers who only work with predictive systems.

We need a change and work with the principle of missions, think about goals, and enable autonomy to achieve them.

For a long time, companies have created a culture of meritocracy based on deliverables and error rejection.

But if we don't master mastery, autonomy, and purpose, we'll never reach real success that is potentialized by the network.

The second step should be to start listening to and valuing information from users, as there are many big things being created without user testing, experimentation, or metrics, things created in secret and launched into darkness – things that can't be found or seen, money thrown away!

We can't delay or slow down the delivery speed; we need to get out and see for ourselves.

The third step is to become comfortable with all the uncertainty that exists.

We have to know that everything around us influences our success, as much as your feedback allows you to perceive!
