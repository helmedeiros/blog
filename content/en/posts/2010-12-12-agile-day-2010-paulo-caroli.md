In the last , it's important to leave visible also which steps in our workflow should be prioritized, which ones really represent a moment when something cannot be changed for a while, so that we don't allow accumulations!

The steps marked Waiting stages should permit pauses and these, in turn, will not be concerning; they are part of the flow.

On the other hand, steps marked Action stages should provide an extra concern while long permanences and accumulations occur.

Card walls also help the team understand its own progress, detailing even more metrics.

A team can perform two projects with the same speed, but experiencing completely different situations during their iterations.

While one might complete all the work only on the last day, struggling, the other might be able to build at the same speed but in small and comfortable daily conclusions.

To do this, the team uses three measures: bandwidth, latency, and throughput

 - which are in that order the quantity of stories or tasks you can do simultaneously (the defines the limit of your bandwidth per step), the time each one takes until it is completed, and finally the flow rate, which considers the time spent moving from one step to another, very used for daily conclusions. _Metric in card wall

 - Paulo Caroli_ It's worth reading the article by Caroli on how they developed a tactic ecologically sustainable but socio-hygienically unfavorable to automate latency evidence. <a title="ARTIGO:

Latency and banana " href="http://www.softwaresecretweapons.com/blog/127/paulo-caroli-latency-and-banana" target="_blank">Latency and banana</a> Then Paulo presented effectively the addition of limits to the card wall, which, according to him, help promote collective consciousness together with the pull system, promoting constant movement in the team for action stages due to the impossibility of promoting a task due to an existing limit.

According to Paulo, limits can also be added to a sequence of prioritization by elevation on the card wall, where the closer a story is to the top of the frame, the more priority it has, so that we can work even more reactively with the team's changes and process flow in an auto-organized way!

What's higher is more important; each member of the team only executes one task at a time, there is a limit in some steps!

Then everything flows prioritarily and no one works outside the necessary order!

In a card wall, you can also find tasks below the granularity of user stories.

The cardwall works with stories, which are divided into tasks, so within each phase we would have development in new lanes like to-do, doing, and done!

See <a title="Blog Alisson Vale" href="http://alissonvale.com/englishblog/" target="_blank">blog Alisson Vale,</a> that talks a little more about this technique of sub-representation.

Another subdivision that surrounds card walls and is reality in any software project, even those with , are BUGS.

For Caroli, these should be evidenced and prioritized!

When there are many bugs, they should be elevated to a new lane that must be treated according to the rules of a <a title="pista de ultrpassagem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_lane" target="_blank">passing lane</a>, you must always leave it empty and only use it in critical moments, whoever is there is always at a higher speed and is always priority!

The Apulo presentation ended with a set of questions about which refactoring was emphasized, adapting during collective times in their team.

Try to take advantage of the other dimensions of your board!

Complement it with other technologies! <a title="Apresentação" href="http://www.slideshare.net/paulocaroli/a-linha-de-montagem-de-sw" target="_blank">Slides Linha Montagem Software</a>
