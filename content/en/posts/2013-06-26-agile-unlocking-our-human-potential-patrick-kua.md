Patrick has been working with software for a while, and many problems later he sees agile methods as a way to make it happen, potentially amplifying thinking.

In the past, there was an impression that motivation was tied to obligation, and it seemed not to work over time, but with the passage of days, it seemed that the best idea was to put more money into the mix, bonuses among others, but just like Agile Brazil saw that many people engage in organizing events and other things thinking about Autonomy, Excellence, and Purpose (ideas from <a title="Dan pink site" href="http://www.danpink.com/" target="_blank">daniel pink</a>) and from this shift in perspective they began to self-motivate, feel happier contributing to something better, being better and doing it when they wanted to.

Having that as background, we have Patrick working on a system advised by XP, using TDD, continuous integration, retrospectives, use stories.

And that was very exciting because there was less waste and products flowed with multiple interactions and integration between the IT teams and development teams.

For Patrick, this success is related to how good the relationship is between these teams, and that in turn is totally related to the frequency of deliveries.

The business respects technological decisions, but we need to make them gradually solve problems and encourage this good camaraderie.

This has to be sustained and sought.

Many times the team doesn't have the freedom or autonomy to choose or decide how to proceed, but the use of the same is more related to passion in doing it and then with these results generated confidence creates fruits!!

Never suppress enthusiasm; use a way to channel it.

We need to let go, and that can be a bit difficult at some stages, and in an unmodified cycle or with a little help, it can be very complicated.

Patrick believes that at this point we have ease generated by agile methods, such as failing quickly and discovering what needs improvement through feedback.

There are 5 stages when someone is seeking excellence on a certain subject.

When you're a newcomer to something, you should learn, listen, and practice a lot, follow instructors, etc.

Passing from the advanced stage to an initiate, to a competent person, we should start to transcend those barriers a bit and discover what we can do even better... and this advances until we reach a level where we don't need to think about it anymore; we already know what will work.

Agile methods and their practices encourage us to go down the right path, allowing us to change and improve how we communicate, deliver what needs to be delivered.

We can see cooperation and intrinsic leadership in how agile methods lead us to live.

THE MORE DIVERSED OUR TEAMS ARE AND THE GREATER THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THEM, THE BETTER!

Agile leaders, who are most of those working, are not people who command or tell everyone what to do, but those who help others with their qualities.

The final message: think about autonomy, excellence, and purpose, cooperation and leadership; the event will help us with that!! @pakua <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
