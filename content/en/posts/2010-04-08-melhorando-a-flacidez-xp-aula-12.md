First lesson on the XP agile methodology taught alongside Potiguar University.

In this lesson, flaws in other methodologies, including agile ones, were presented regarding disregard for the internal quality of projects, which reinforces, according to Martin Fowler in <a title="FlaccidScrum" href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html" target="_blank">Scrum Fl√°cido</a> the need for methodologies focused on technical practices that remove and do not add technical debt.

The problems found in software environments and XP's solutions for these same issues are also presented.

Finally, the values that guide this methodology are highlighted. [slideshare id=3666315&doc=unp-aula12-100408092336-phpapp02]
