Mike Keith's lecture started at 11:00 am, following a coffee break, with some jokes and questions about how much time passed between new Java version launches. The audience didn't find it too long or short and wasn't interested in the slide from that moment, which showed the phrase "Or doesn't care because they think Microsoft will kill Java." I know there might be issues saying something like this at some point... but based on what I've been listening to here in Rio, as per Phillip himself, .NET with C# has been presenting some nice things…

I thought it was cool among the new features that new annotations were introduced for dealing with Servlets and handling necessary pieces for servlet frameworks in our web.xml. However, to transform servlet calls into asynchronous (Async Processing) processing... there was complete silence in the auditorium!!
Mike thought nobody would assume using EJB at some point, but believes now with version 3.1 everyone will want to do it... I don't know... as a representative of Oracle and Sun... maybe he would too. At that moment, the new features of EJB 3.1 were discussed.
The part about JPA was moved to a short conversation later in the afternoon.
Mike spoke about JSR 330 and how the new version of injection Annotations incorporates this specification, leaving their programs compatible with various solutions.

Mike wrapped up by saying that the solutions already in the public domain and specifications can be accessed from December 10th, 2009, and that these solutions are filled with user desires.
