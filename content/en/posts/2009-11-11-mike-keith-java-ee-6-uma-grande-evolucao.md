I know there might have been problems saying something like that at some point... but from what I've heard here in Rio, according to Phillip himself, .NET with C

# has been showing some cool things...

I found it quite cool among the new features were the new annotations for dealing with Servlets and treating the necessary pieces for servlet frameworks in our web.xml.

However, to transform servlet calls into asynchronous (Async Processing) ... there is a need for so much unnecessary and crossed code that there was silence in the auditorium !!

Mike said that at some point nobody would assume using EJB, but he believes now with version 3.1 everyone will want to do it...

I don't know... as a representative of Oracle and Sun... maybe they would also think so.

At this moment, the new features of EJB 3.1 were discussed.

The part about JPA was transferred to a short conversation in the afternoon.

Mike spoke about JSR 330, and how the new version of injection Annotations incorporates this specification, leaving their programs compatible with various solutions.

Mike concluded by informing that the public domain and specification solutions can be checked from December 10, 2009, and that the solutions are filled with user desires.
