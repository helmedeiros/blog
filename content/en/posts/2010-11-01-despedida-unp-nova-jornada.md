With a heavy but grateful heart, I share that this will be my final semester teaching at Universidade Potiguar (UnP). It's a decision I made with care, reflection, and excitement for what lies ahead.

## Porto Alegre was calling

Since the start of my journey as a developer, I've always been driven by technical challenges. That drive took me into communities, languages, and projects beyond the ordinary. And it was that same curiosity that made me fall in love with the tech scene at PUC-RS in Porto Alegre.

Visiting the city and seeing companies solving global problems with diverse, technically mature teams sparked something in me. I couldn't ignore it. It was time to step out of my comfort zone and dive into something new.

## A heartfelt goodbye

Across many semesters, I learned from my students, exchanged ideas with fellow professors, and worked to make the classroom a space that was practical, critical, and inspiring. Each group taught me something — patience, improvisation, creativity, resilience.

I'm deeply thankful to UnP for trusting me with this opportunity, to Gedson Nunes for his continued support, and to all the teachers I had the pleasure to collaborate with. And to the students: thank you. For your questions, your presence, your last-minute Calculus exam excuses, and most importantly, your honesty and energy.

## The road ahead

I'm not leaving education behind. I carry all this learning into my next chapter — where I hope to continue sharing knowledge, just in new formats and different spaces.

Maybe we'll cross paths again at events, in a community, or in another classroom.

Thank you. Truly. See you soon.

19. **Closing a Chapter: Gratitude and New Paths** - The journey continues (Final)

This series represents more than technical content—it's a journey through the evolution of software engineering thinking, from rigid processes to adaptive methodologies, from individual coding to collaborative engineering, and ultimately to the recognition that great software engineering combines technical excellence with human wisdom.

The classroom taught me that software engineering is fundamentally about people: understanding their needs, working together effectively, and building systems that truly serve. Whether you're starting your journey or reflecting on years of experience, remember that our field uniquely blends analytical thinking with creative problem-solving, systematic approaches with adaptive learning.

As this teaching chapter closes, the learning continues. The principles, practices, and human insights from these lectures will influence the next phase of my journey, carrying forward the commitment to quality, collaboration, and continuous growth that defines our profession.

Keep learning, keep teaching, and keep building software that makes a difference.
