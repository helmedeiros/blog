I think that every project, whether here or in China, has something similar at its beginning, something that allows for foundation, growth, and continued improvement... Following the enthusiastic speeches about Lean Startups, among many others I've heard from small, medium, and large entrepreneurs, it's certain to conclude that success is a long path of learning, where our only certainty is that ideas will emerge and when implemented can be successful or not.

Learn, think, publish, extract, and learn... right? Well, we really have to learn, but our ideas and the perception of those involved in our projects (users, collaborators, and suppliers) are a fruit of something deeper, and simply dismissing them doesn't sound very HYGIENIC or intelligent. People change, and this something more profound IS CULTURE is constantly changing.

Recently I took an introspective journey to understand a bit more about the culture involved behind social networks, talked to people, listened to them, and also experienced my own experiences, passing on my ideas and seeing them transform into new perspectives. After 233 check-ins, 11 badges, and countless tips followed, I think I had a glimpse of what motivates me and perhaps other people to use them. Badges? Social involvement? Status elevation? Overwhelming cool?

This is a valid experience when we're not building a new application to address our problems. When we don't know our audience closely, nothing beats a good conversation on the sofa or at lunch, something subjectively time-consuming and frank.

During this time countless ideas were written in a notebook that always accompanies me, and how many of us haven't had ideas and more ideas that were commented, noted, implemented, and miserably forgotten. Last Saturday, November 26, 2011, I presented during DESCONF 2011 a glimpse of my learning-based on co-evolving ideas. IDEAS ARE VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN WITHOUT ABLATION, the act of REMEMBERING AND FORGETTING THEM can take us to the margins of success and technological vanguard.

Remembering and forgetting ideas? Follow them and wisely discard
Some time ago I saw the movie Last Holiday, which presents the life story behind the main character played by Queen Latifah in her last week of life, and I was struck by a positive relationship between the film's book of possibilities and our backlogs, and I've been applying it since then. The character had a book where all her future aspirations as a perfect husband, home, travel, and domesticity were stored and worked on to come true. Sometimes we have to take our hat off to novelists who concretize and personify cultural behaviors in their works. And after my analysis of the culture behind Foursquare's virtual society, I had my book of possibilities.

MY BOOK OF POSSIBILITIES in my entrepreneurial vision complements the concept of success through learning, and this learning doesn't need to be finite or dated, it can be a continuous accompaniment to technological, financial, legal, and cultural changes that restrict it. So we should add our daily work or alongside our PO's activities, the tracking of ideas we see possible for a near future that may take us to positions of vanguard. Keeping MVP can be today's guarantee for success, but when everyone presents the same behavior, don't look anymore, but follow, influential factors can give you preference in success.

I heard during Agile Brazil 2011 from Henrique Imbertti about Yahoo!'s MEME team adapting their storyboard to implement a learning cycle, and I believe that what is perceived does not need to be totally dismissed now, but rather followed when detected restrictions are not temporarily immutable and may mean great competitive advantage.

Many companies produce quality systems but that serve nothing for their users, pivot innumerable times but seem always to point to the wrong path. With mapped ideas and the inherent culture of the segment our application is destined for, the entrepreneur must step out of his position as younger brother desperately trying to follow the older brothers' game. Channels and consumption waves emerge every day, or you possess an environment where they normally arise and transform or you create one. BUT DON'T FORGET TO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN!
