Following the enthusiastic speeches about Lean Startups, among many others I've heard from small, medium, and large entrepreneurs, it's certain to conclude that success is a long path of learning, where our only certainty is that ideas will emerge and when implemented can be successful or not.

Learn what?

Think, publish, extract, and learn... right?

Well, we really have to learn, but our ideas and the perception of those involved in our projects (users, collaborators, and suppliers) are a fruit of something deeper, and simply dismissing them doesn't sound at all HYGIENIC or intelligent.

People change, and this deeper something CULTURE is constantly changing.

Recently, I went on an introspective journey to understand a bit more about the culture behind social networks, talked to people, listened, and also made my own experiences passing my ideas and seeing them transform over new perspectives.

After 233 check-ins, 11 badges, and countless tips followed, I think I had a glimpse of what would motivate me and maybe other people too.

Badges?

Social involvement?

Elevation of status?

Being overwhelmed by cool?

This is a valid experience when we're not building a new application to address our problems.

When we don't know our audience up close, nothing beats a good conversation on the sofa or at lunchtime, something subjectively slow and honest.

During this time, countless ideas were written in a [caderno][2] that always accompanies me, and how many of us haven't already had ideas and more ideas that have been commented on, noted, implemented, and miserably forgotten?

On November 26th, 2011, I presented during the [DESCONF 2011][3] a glimpse of this my learning based on co-evolving ideas.

IDEAS ARE VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN WITHOUT A BIT OF PESSIMISM, the act of [LEMBRAR-MOS E ESQUECER-MOS][4] THEM may take us to the edges of success and technological vanguard. <figure id="attachment_439" style="width: 474px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"> [<img class="size-full wp-image-439" src="/uploads/2011/11/DEsconf2011.png" alt="" width="474" height="228" srcset="/uploads/2011/11/DEsconf2011.png 520w, /uploads/2011/11/DEsconf2011-300x144.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" />][5] <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Remember and Forget ideas?

Follow them and wisely discard</figcaption></figure> A while ago, I saw the movie [Last Holiday][6], which presents the life story behind the main character played by [Queen Latifah][7] in her last week of life, and I found a positive relationship between the film's book of possibilities and our backlogs, and I've been applying it ever since.

The character had a book where all her future expectations as a perfect husband, house, travel, and domestic routines were stored and worked on to come true.

MAS NÃO ESQUEÇA DE MANTER OS SEUS OLHOS ABERTOS!
