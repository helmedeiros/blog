Second lesson on XP agile methodology taught along with Universidade Potiguar. In this lesson, forms found by XP to transmit its values, materializing them through actions, decisions, and practices were presented. Basic and less fundamental principles as well as XP practices were introduced. Finally, the exposed relationships diagramed by Kent Beck in Extreme Programming Explained showing integration proposed for established but failed practices in other environments, which now show their collective strength in this extreme action methodology.
