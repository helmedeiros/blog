Second lesson on Agile XP methodology taught together with Universidade Potiguar.

In this lesson, the forms found by XP to transmit its values were presented, materializing them through actions, decisions, and practices.

The basic and less fundamental principles are presented, as well XP practices.

Finally, the relationships exposed by Kent Beck in Extreme Programming Explained are diagrammed, showing the integration proposed for consecrated practices that had failed in other environments, which now show their collective strength in this extreme action methodology. <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
