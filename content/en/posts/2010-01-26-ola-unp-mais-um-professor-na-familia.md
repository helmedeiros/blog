I didn't expect this to happen so soon. Academia, I was told, is a long path — one that favors the most experienced. But in 2010, **my family gains one more teacher**.

## A Longtime Dream

From a young age, I admired the teachers in my family. My mother, for example, was often remembered fondly by former students who came back to say thank you. My sisters also followed this path and, after years as skilled professionals, began teaching and sharing what they had conquered and learned. My oldest sister, in fact, was my professor during my Information Systems degree.

## The Time Has Come!

Starting **February 22, 2010**, I will teach my first class at **Universidade Potiguar (UnP)**, leading the course in **Software Engineering** for fifth-semester students.

This opportunity came after going through a selection process. It's an honor to return to the university where I earned my degree — now not as a student, but as someone committed to giving back to the academic community that shaped me.

## Software with Purpose

Over the past few years, I've been immersed in topics like **agile development, software engineering, and system quality**. I've studied how to deliver sustainable solutions, maximize value, and support continuous improvement through team collaboration.

> Concepts like _ROI up-front_, _evolutionary design_, _clean code_, and _XP practices_ are part of my toolkit — and now part of my lesson plans.

## My Commitment in the Classroom

I want my students to learn more than requirements or diagrams. I want them to understand **how real software is built** — collaboratively, responsibly, and with context.

My classes will aim to:

- Simulate real projects
- Review code as a team
- Apply practices like automated testing and continuous integration
- Discuss ethics and design decisions openly

## Gratitude and Responsibility

I feel honored to step into this new role. To teach is, above all, a commitment to someone else's future — and a powerful opportunity to keep learning every day.

> One more teacher in the family… I hope to live up to both my old last name, and the new one.
