I didn't expect this could happen so soon, since the academic flow always takes a long time and usually passes over more experienced people.

But it happens that in 2010 my family will gain a new professor.

I've always had this dream, just like my family, to be able to teach one day and maybe help build the foundations of some careers, just I'm used to hearing great people referring to my mother; or maybe receive unconditional affection from students... materialized in chocolates, apples, and other things... like my older sister. <figure id="attachment_114" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"> <img class="size-full wp-image-114" src="" alt="Ai vou eu !!!" width="400" height="234" srcset=" 400w, 300w" sizes="" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ai vou eu !!!</figcaption></figure> I believe the day has come!

I will be teaching from February 22nd onwards, after participating in a selective process, alongside students of the fifth period at the University Potiguar (UnP) teaching Software Engineering.

After having contact as a laureate student of graduation, a boring post-graduate student, and seeing many excellent professionals returning to classrooms to contribute to the academic community, I am proud to say that it's my turn!

I've been specializing in this subject for some time; as a good agilist, I'm working hard to build software with quality and focused on a big ROI-up-front, influencing and being influenced by teams wherever I go; I hope to bring a bit of this to class and together with students build new and excellent systems, setting up stakes and raising walls in real practices that will make a difference in the daily life of the community and market.

Another professor in the family...

I hope to do justice to my old surname and the new one!!
