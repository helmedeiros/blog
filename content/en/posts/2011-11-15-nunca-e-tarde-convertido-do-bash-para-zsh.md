After **PLACEHOLDER**, the zsh shell is present on your MacOsx machine, and you can start using it without having to search for how-tos or configure it manually.

As I mentioned before, the zsh is present on darwin, so if you have installed an old or new version of MacOsx like I had, you won't need to spend hours searching for **PLACEHOLDER** or looking at various how-tos. Not even to customize in colors, aliases, functions, and auto-completes if you use **PLACEHOLDER**. As described on the link next to the README project, zsh is magical for those who don't have much time to waste:

> "A community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. Includes optional plugins for various tools (rails, git, OSX, brew,...), nearly 80 terminal themes, and an auto-updating tool so that you can keep up with the latest improvements from the community."

To make everything work, you can do the following:

- Use the automatic installer created by Robby Russell: **PLACEHOLDER**
- If you don't have **PLACEHOLDER** installed, it's very likely that you'll see an error on the console. This is a great opportunity to install it using **PLACEHOLDER**.
- To install brew: **PLACEHOLDER**
- To install wget: **PLACEHOLDER**

When everything is finished, you'll see a screen like this, then just open a new session to see Robby Russell's theme making its magic.
