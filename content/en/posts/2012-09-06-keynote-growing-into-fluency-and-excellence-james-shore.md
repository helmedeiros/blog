James Shore started his presentation at 09:10 talking about how he got involved in his first project using FDD, with many practices that involved the client and prototyping, and after several deliveries, the project was CLOSED. And one thing he noticed for the first time was how even inert people in realizing agile practices without the necessary cultural evolution, ended up and continued to worry about unimportant points, leaving concern about where the money comes from, for example, out of it. It's no use building something quickly that's wrong.

The project magically received new resources, and after such a period of bitterness, everything changed! According to James, this made him realize and encourage constant questioning about what to do, how much value was being generated, but even so, you can still create the wrong product. The thing is, if everyone hasn't suffered and evolved together, we can continue with people LYING or they don't know what they want and don't care that their vision isn't going in the right direction. Good projects are those that make us learn more and see possibilities that were previously invisible.

After this project, there were others with proposals for change to new paradigms like XP, which he rejected at first! Pair programming is very ridiculous, evolutionary design is certainly not going to work, remember that back then in 1999 everything was very big at the beginning (BDUF). But as time went by, new ideas started flowing, and applying these practices generated many changes that brought a lot of benefit, even with naive beginnings. And from this moment until today, James Shore continues teaching Agile to this day.

And then ideas like Artisanal Retro-Futurism crossed with Team-Scale Anarcho-Syndicalism (http://arxta.net/) emerged, where you work together to create something beautiful and valuable, not just for yourself but for everyone. This is the essence of what I'm talking about.

The Agile team's path to fluency

James Shore presented himself as a lover of good code, and one thing he finds incredible is how big companies don't care about it and have terrible code that holds them back from improving their deliveries, so they can't really achieve the necessary changes in business, and here lies the value of the team. And while everyone is satisfied with their clients, you end up only delivering outside of market time. So both are directly linked and therefore the growth of the team's skills cannot be forgotten when talking about agility.

But it's not just that, if people on your team and you aren't concerned with the success of others, they'll end up looking for someone who can do it. And these items are essential for improvement and achieving real excellence. "Good business forms a company, bad technology kills the company, and it's all about people".

Components of a fluent environment

For James, it shouldn't be everyone's goal to achieve 4 stars, because companies are different and have different resources, teams, and levels that provide great advantages over others and fluency in some of these already makes you better than what is. One star makes you fluent in Agile Fundamentals, the second star gets you sustained agility, the third is a promise of agility, and finally the future of agility. But again, your company should seek growth but the goal shouldn't really be more agile, but rather to use it to your advantage.

But how do we know where we are? To evaluate whether the next step is where we want to be? What about metrics? Then who knows after finding all this path to quality that we can really thank and be sure we're working in the best places at the best time of our lives!!
