The [James Shore][1] started his presentation at 09:10 talking about how he got involved in a first project using <a title="Feature Driven Development" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-driven_development" target="_blank">FDD</a>, with various practices involving the client and prototypes.

After several deliveries, the project was CLOSED, and something that he noticed for the first time was that even without cultural evolution, we still continue to worry about unimportant points, leaving out concerns about where the money comes from, for example.

It doesn't make sense <a title="Construindo rapidamente a coisa certa!" href="http://www.helmed.net/blog/2012/09/05/the-role-of-agile-analysis-in-continuous-delivery-jenny-wong-e-danilo-sato/" target="_blank">construir rapidamente a coisa errada</a>.

The project magically received new resources, and after that period of bitterness, everything changed!

According to James, this blow made him realize and encouraged him to constantly question what to do, how much value was being generated, but even so, it's possible to keep creating the wrong product.

The thing is, if everyone hasn't suffered and evolved together, we can continue with people LYING or not knowing what they want and not caring that their vision isn't on the right path.

Good projects are those that make you learn more and envision possibilities that were previously invisible.

After this project, there were others with proposals for change to new paradigms like [XP][2], which he rejected outright!

Pair programming is very ridiculous, design evolution is certainly not going to work, and .

By the end of this journey, we realized that it's not just about being Agile; it's about being excellent in every aspect.

It's not just about delivering software; it's about delivering value.

And it's not just about working in a team; it's about working together as one.

This growth happened very quickly but with a natural progression, not just presenting but really participating in the experience of truly improving, delivering not only value but the greatest possible value!

Excellent, isn't it? <figure id="attachment_619" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"> [<img class="size-full wp-image-619" src="/uploads/2012/09/diagramaInicial.png" alt="O caminho de uma equipe através de fluência ágil " width="470" height="249" srcset="/uploads/2012/09/diagramaInicial.png 470w, /uploads/2012/09/diagramaInicial-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" />][8]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The path of a team through Agile fluency</figcaption></figure> James Shore presented himself as a lover of good code, and one thing he finds incredible is that large companies don't care about this, and they have terrible code that holds them back from improving their deliveries, so they can't really achieve the necessary changes in the business, and here's where the team value lies.

And while everyone is satisfied with their clients, you'll just deliver outside of market time.

So, both are directly linked, and therefore the growth of the team's skills cannot be forgotten when talking about agility.

But it's not just that; if people on your team and you aren't worried about the success of individuals, they will end up looking for others to do it for them.

And these items are indispensable for improvement and achieving real excellence. “Good businesses form a company, bad technology kills the company, and this is all tied together with people.” <figure id="attachment_616" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"> [<img class="size-full wp-image-616" src="/uploads/2012/09/internaEstrela.jpg" alt="Componentes de um ambiente fluente" width="470" height="249" srcset="/uploads/2012/09/internaEstrela.jpg 470w, /uploads/2012/09/internaEstrela-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" />][9]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Components of a fluent environment</figcaption></figure> For James, it shouldn't be the goal for everyone to reach four stars, because companies are different and have different resources, teams, and levels that provide great advantages over others and fluency in some of these already makes them better than they are.

One star makes you fluent in Agile Fundamentals, with the second star, you've achieved sustainable Agile, the third is a promise of Agile, and finally, the future of Agile.

But again, your company should strive for growth, but the goal shouldn't be to just get more agile, but to use it to your advantage.

But how do we know where we are, to evaluate if the next step is where we want to be?

What about metrics?

Then who knows after finding this path to quality that we can really appreciate and be certain that we're working in the best places at the best time in our lives!!
