> **Series: Software Engineering Fundamentals** | **Part 5 of 14** > _Delivered at Universidade Potiguar (UnP) in 2010_

**In the fifth Software Engineering lecture** at Universidade Potiguar (UnP), we explored one of the most transformative topics in modern development: agile approaches. Grounded in the Agile Manifesto, we focused not just on practices, but on mindsets that change how teams think, organize, and deliver value.

## Agility is a mindset, not a method

We began by unpacking what it truly means to "be agile." I presented Jim Highsmith's definition: **the ability to create and respond to change**. This demands more than technique—it requires an open mindset, courage to revise the plan, and a commitment to constant collaboration.

It's not just about iterating fast. Agility is about building environments that balance stability and flexibility. It's about putting people at the center of software development, reducing bureaucracy, and improving communication.

## Activity: What is NOT agile?

I asked students to watch a popular satirical video about fake agile practices. Then, in groups, they listed real-world examples of agile misinterpretations they had seen or experienced.

This activity works for any team trying to implement Agile. It acts like a mirror—and a warning. The goal is to emphasize that adopting the term "agile" without embracing its principles leads to frustration, not transformation. It's a simple exercise, with high impact, and sparks essential conversations in teams or classrooms.

## Deliver working software, not just plans

We dove into the Manifesto and its four core values, especially the first: **individuals and interactions over processes and tools**. We discussed how no process can save a team that doesn't communicate well, and how tools only help when used with intention.

We also examined the value of working software over comprehensive documentation. It's not about ignoring documents—it's about understanding that visible, validated delivery is what drives projects forward. Documents support; they don't replace real interaction.

## Iterative development and the power of focus

I introduced the concept of iteration as "a fixed timeframe with flexible scope." It helps maintain fixed budgets and deadlines while adjusting functionality along the way. The client prioritizes, the team delivers, and feedback closes the loop.

Using a visual example, I showed how distributing features across iterations within a release helps **reduce risk and increase predictability**—a must for organizations that want to innovate without breaking the flow.

## Scrum, XP, FDD: Different paths, same goal

We briefly covered three practical approaches: Scrum, XP, and FDD. Each one tackles different pieces of the agile puzzle. Scrum manages projects, XP strengthens code quality, and FDD focuses on functionality-driven discovery.

It's important that students and professionals understand: agility isn't a fixed package. It's a set of principles supported by practices that fit your context. Success comes from adaptation, not rigid adoption.

## Facilitating agility with intention

If you want to replicate this lesson in your team or organization, my suggestion is: start with the pain. Highlight frustrations around missed deadlines, resistance to change, unread documentation.

Then present agility as a potential response. Use videos, bring the Manifesto to life with real-world examples, and run reflection activities. Don't demand blind adoption—invite curiosity. Transformation only happens when people believe in it.
