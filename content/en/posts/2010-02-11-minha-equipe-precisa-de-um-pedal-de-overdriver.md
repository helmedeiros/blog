I've been researching about relationships and how we can work together with teams to naturally achieve happiness and productivity.

I was in Rio some time ago and heard([tudo que eu queria saber antes de virar um líder técnico][1]), just like I had read on some blogs, that if we want to learn or apply something in our daily lives that positively impacts our work, we should do it ourselves and not wait for supervisors or colleagues.

It's by showing the improvements that one truly achieves recognition of success.

But then why do we see so many unhappy developers?

Or why can't we make it happen on our own?

I was reading again a little while ago Kent Beck's words and his analogies about project leadership as a control panel, just like XP proposes to turn all the knobs and reach our much-awaited success!

I haven't yet managed to get that many people collaborating with the necessary metrics and practices.

I can tell you that it sometimes seems distant depending on your position, but a good distortion pedal with its buttons perfectly regulated can make a big impact!

As I mentioned earlier, I'll be working soon as a teacher at one of my city's educational institutions and hope to contribute to regulating various pedals!

Because we can't work in the market quietly about what really interests us.

We truly want to give our best so that our clients' systems are successful.
