I've been researching on this for a while about how we can work together with teams to build a naturally happy and productive growth.
I was there a little while ago in Rio and heard everything I wanted to know before becoming a technical leader, just like I had read in some blogs. According to what I learned, if we want to learn or apply something in our daily lives that positively impacts our work, we should do it ourselves and not wait for bosses or colleagues; it's showing improvements that truly achieves recognition of success. But then why do we see so many unhappy developers? Or why can't we do it ourselves?

I was re-reading Kent Beck's words and his analogies on project leadership as a control panel, proposing to turn all the knobs and reach our long-awaited success! I still couldn't get many people collaborating with metrics and necessary practices. You know, sometimes it seems far-off depending on your position, but a good distortion pedal with buttons perfectly adjusted can make a big impact!
As I mentioned earlier, I'll be working soon as an instructor at one of the educational institutions in my city and hope to contribute to regulating various pedals! Why can't we work peacefully in what really interests us? We genuinely want to give our best so that our clients' systems are successful.
