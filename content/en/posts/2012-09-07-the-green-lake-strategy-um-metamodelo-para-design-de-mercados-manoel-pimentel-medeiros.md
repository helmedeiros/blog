The Ocean Blue strategy is a book that teaches how to create and work with markets, and goes from finding blue oceans without competition to red oceans full of competition. And the entry into this market is usually based on leveraging and differentiating at a low cost. But "how can we escape the red ocean" find unexplored markets where you can be alone or where competition is irrelevant, where differentiation through innovation can be made by the value generated, which is directly scored by the market. The Ocean Blue may take you to nirvana.

There's a point of discomfort, with questioning whether someone has already created an ocean? How do we get out of one ocean and enter another? Can we think in terms of competitive advantage? Or perhaps competitive implication?

Competitive implication asks about what value, rarity, difficulty of being imitated, can we take advantage of this imitability of the product (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRIO). Products are copyable! Strategies aren't, or maybe more difficultly! So what if we apply VRIO to strategies?

What These Portfolios Are Missing

The ocean you discover, but the lake you create! Then Manuel presents a new idea to not leave the red ocean for the blue one, but rather create an internal ecosystem within the red ocean through a green lake that can be developed, designed, and evolved, allowing for future connection to new markets, the Ocean Blue.

The green lake and the creation of this ecosystem start with the creation of a strategy beyond the product, with a market design that shows how your product will behave internally in a market or before a public. But how do we know what our product is so that we can create this ecosystem?

Manuel presented the Xis gaúcho, a spectacular and common product in the Porto Alegre market, but uncommon in the Brazilian market, will more sandwiches in Brasília be copyable? What's the rarity or VRIO of the same? According to Manuel, the product is easily copyable, but the strategy that facilitates it, in logistics among other points, are completely and concretely elaborated. Green lake going into the Ocean Blue within the red sea.

Growth can be grown from within the lake as is the case with McDonald's franchises and Boticário, little work is done to sell these franchises within this ecosystem, the lake expands. Imagine Apple stores, how the created ecosystem proves internal growth in app sales, etc.

The lake needs to be cared for always, franchisees need to be accessed, and the growth of this side is given by the success of its participants (TAE – Star Theory).

How do we care for the lake? First, we create a meta-product, then we create the ecosystem, capture, feeding/maintenance, and finally, growth of the lake. There are no correct paths, and this realization has no dependence on supernatural gifts. The tip is that it's easier to create a lake than an ocean!
