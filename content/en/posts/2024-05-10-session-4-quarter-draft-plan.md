subtitle: Build a visual, collaborative quarter plan that creates shared alignment without rigid timelinesâ€”turning intentions into executable roadmaps
---

After defining our OKRs, shaping milestones, and evaluating effort and dependencies, it's time to zoom out. Session #4 is where we bring it all together. But not by locking a roadmap. Instead, we build a **visual draft**â€”one that reflects how we believe the quarter might unfold based on what we know today.

This isn't a Gantt chart. This is a conversation canvas. It allows teams to align, anticipate, and adjust. It gives everyoneâ€”from engineers to PMs to designers to stakeholdersâ€”a shared artifact to reference and challenge as the quarter progresses.

This session should be run after Session #3 when you now understand what's possible and needed, and before sprint prep to set up a planning process rooted in context.

## Session Overview

**Total Duration:** 75 minutes
**Participants:** 4-8 team members (cross-functional)
**Materials:** Collaboration board (Miro/Figma), milestone cards with scoring, timeline template

| Activity                          | Duration | Purpose                                                |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Milestone Selection & Positioning | 30 min   | Each member proposes timeline placement for milestones |
| Annotation                        | 20 min   | Add effort, dependencies, and skills to timeline       |
| Group Discussion                  | 20 min   | Review overlaps, risks, and capacity constraints       |
| Final Sequencing                  | 5 min    | Adjust milestone order and flag key dependencies       |

## 1. Building a Living Plan

Session #4 is not about committing to hard dates. It's about **mapping intention**. Together, the team sequences milestones across a draft timeline:

- Each milestone includes annotations for effort, value, dependencies, skills needed
- Teams place cards across weeks, calling out risk areas, constraints, or parallel work needs
- One person proposes; the rest reactâ€”like a fishbowl dynamic

```

## 2. The Flow of the Session

We typically run this session with four key steps:

1. **Each team member picks a milestone**, reads it aloud, and proposes where it might land based on earlier sessions.
2. **They annotate** effort, dependencies, and skill needs using color or symbols.
3. **Everyone else responds**: Are we overlapping too much? Is this sequence risky? Where are we tight on capacity?
4. **Milestones get moved**, split, sequenced, or flagged.

## 3. Outcome: A Shared Plan, Not a Frozen One

You leave the room with:

- A **visual timeline** of the quarter with mapped milestone intentions
- Clear markers for **where we might need spikes, research, or alignment**
- A sense of **which milestones depend on external unlocks** or deep learning cycles

```markdown
Milestone: Email Feedback MVP
Planned Start: Week 3
Planned End: Week 5
Notes: Depends on DS validation and UX wireframes
Color: Yellow (Experiment), Skills: Design, Backend, DS
```

## 4. A Quarter That Reflects How We Work

Session #4 closes the OKRA loop. It helps the team see time and scope as dimensions we manage togetherâ€”not inputs handed down. We can now:

- Start sprints with clarity, not surprise
- Adjust direction without chaos
- Celebrate learnings and shifts, not just delivery

Most importantly, we have a way to make alignment **visible**. And in agile work, that's often what separates good teams from resilient ones.

This isn't the end of planning. It's the beginning of a quarter **with shared intent**.
