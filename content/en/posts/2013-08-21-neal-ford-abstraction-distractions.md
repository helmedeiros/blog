Speaking about abstractions in today's days is reflecting on the nature of computer science and software engineering. Scalable solutions, routine problems, all go through some moment where we choose how they will be seen by end users, and it is commonly there that we bury our solutions under layers and more layers of abstraction.

We think about ease of understanding, maintenance, and expansion; but how do we deal with the problems that exist in the parts we cover with abstraction? To what extent do layers of abstraction positively influence our understanding and management of some technology?

According to Neal Ford, abstractions accumulate at levels, and these levels need to be meticulously analyzed while considering their impact on future decisions. Not that he implies mediocrity for software engineers; what he suggests is a reflective journey, through 10 lessons, that would prevent our distraction by all elaborate abstractions.

"Don't confuse abstraction with the object itself." Using high-level abstractions was very important for our evolution, thinking about folders and files instead of zeros and ones. Thinking about languages and platforms and how we can gain productivity with them may be easier with layers of abstraction because at some point, just as it was and still is for Emacs, easy extensibility in function definitions can turn against the perpetuation of code that when not maintained definition commands can be lost forever or very costly to recover. Folders and more folders of lost code without interpretation? Martin Fowler treats this subject in: http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InternalReprogrammability.html.
It's worth seeing the talk:
