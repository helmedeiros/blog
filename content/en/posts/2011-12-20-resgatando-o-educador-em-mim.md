_This is Part 6 of 7 in the [Life in Porto Alegre](/en/series/life-in-porto-alegre/) series._

Some people are made to do more than just write code or manage deliverables. Some people are **builders of builders**. They show up in meetings, pull requests, and Slack threads not just to check tasks off a list ‚Äî but to **help others become their best versions**. Marcelo Schmidt is one of those people.

Since I joined Stefanini/Dell, I've had the privilege of watching Schmidt **grow tremendously as a technical leader**. He creates space ‚Äî and then _protects_ that space ‚Äî for engineers to try, fail, teach, reflect, and improve. He doesn't speak at conferences but he **inspires people to believe they can do it**.

### The Part of Me That Went Standby

For a while, I had put that part of me ‚Äî the one that **loves to teach** ‚Äî on pause. Life had taken me elsewhere: moving cities, adjusting to new stacks, new roles, family health crises. But watching Marcelo build knowledge-sharing environments from the inside, with care and intent, made me realize something:

That part of me was still there. And it wasn't lost. It was just waiting for the right kind of **permission and push**. And Marcelo, without even trying, gave me both.

### How to Start Sharing Again

You don't need to be an expert. You just need to **notice what you repeat**, what you debug five times a week, what you explain every other sprint. Those are your _best sessions_ ‚Äî because they're the closest to your everyday work.

Here's how I've been nudging myself back into sharing:

- ‚úèÔ∏è **Start a dev log**: At the end of the day, jot down what was hard and how you solved it.
- üß™ **Refactor problems into examples**: That recursive API bug? Great for a 10-minute brown bag.
- üß≠ **Create just-in-time content**: Got a teammate stuck? Solve it, document it, and post it.
- üí¨ **Encourage debates**: Start with "I'm not sure if this is the best way‚Ä¶" ‚Äî and let the learning flow.

```bash
# Quick start content seed template
Title: How we refactored our OSB mappings
Why: recurring issue in onboarding
Outcome: new internal doc + onboarding session
```

### Teach What You're Living

You'll find the most powerful learning **in the things you struggle with and solve in real time**. Don't wait until you're an "expert." Write or speak while it's still messy. It makes you more honest, and it gives others a clearer path to follow.

```python
def teachable_moment(problem, solution):
    if problem.is_recent() and solution.is_fresh():
        return share_with_team(problem, solution)
```

### A Tribute and a Reminder

Schmidt, thank you. For making the space. For holding the space. For showing how leadership in tech isn't about knowing more ‚Äî it's about **lifting more**.

And for everyone else reading this: if you've put your teacher-self on pause, maybe it's time to hit **resume**. The next voice someone needs might be yours.

Let's keep building.
