This year, only <a title="@dwildt" href="https://twitter.com/dwildt" target="_blank">Daniel Wildt</a> and [Natalia Arsand][1] organized the event, which was spectacular like the other editions, but in a shorter format with approximately 28 participants, including 20 speakers and 8 presenters.

As for an event completely outside of the standards of desconf, I had mentioned before <a title="DESCONF 2011-Mustache edition" href="http://www.helmed.net/blog/2011/11/29/desconf-2011-mustache-edition/" target="_blank">por aqui</a>, it has a very tight format that maximizes the first contact between interested parties on a subject; or even guarantees the creation of new ideas based on metaphors extracted.

Speakers with their <a title="Lightning Talks" href="http://blog.desconf.com.br/introducao-rapida-a-lightning-talks" target="_blank">inSigth de 5min</a>, and presenters with their enormous interests in learning and sharing, the magic happens in less than 2 hours.

This year's event took place inside <a title="TecnoPUC" href="http://www.pucrs.br/agt/tecnopuc/" target="_blank">TecnoPUC</a> at the ASSESPRO-RS Auditorium (Building 96D).

As a central point, I expected we would have more people to exchange ideas than last year, but ultimately, there was nothing to complain about; the ideas presented were just as good.

The event began at 19:00h with an open coffee break in the auditorium itself, which was a great strategy for getting the presenters familiar with the location and where we would spend the next 2 hours, or rather, 3 hours, exchanging many ideas.

At 20:00h, Daniel gave the starting signal with a quick talk that took less than 5 minutes to familiarize new unconference participants with the history and dynamics of the event; basically, we didn't have an order for presentations, so each speaker felt the affinity between subjects and presented themselves as candidates for the next presentation. ...
