We had a debate in our Master's class over the last few days about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front" title="Big Design Up Front" target="_blank">BDUF</a>, and whether it would be possible to reduce the baggage of non-compilable documents by composing new templates together with RUP, as some professionals from the school scope have suggested. The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a software engineering process that offers an approach based on disciplines to assign tasks and responsibilities within a development organization; guided by the principles <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/oct05/kroll/index.html" title="ABCDE" target="_blank">ABCDE</a> of <a href="http://www.devx.com/ibm/Article/30308" title="Business Driven Development" target="_blank">BDD</a>, which ensures a flexible process with management of priority levels and collaboration among team members. Therefore, we tried to create this template that would fit well into our daily needs.
