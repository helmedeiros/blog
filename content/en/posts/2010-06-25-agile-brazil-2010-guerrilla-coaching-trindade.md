Great session by **Francisco Trindade**, titled _"Coaching de Guerrilha"_. I had no idea I'd leave that room thinking so deeply about influence, leadership, and change — all without needing a title.

## Change Without Authority

The first shock came early: **you don't need formal authority to start a change**. Francisco walked us through stories and frameworks where change agents emerged quietly, persistently — often without permission. It was empowering, especially for those of us who often find ourselves at the edges of the decision-making chain, frustrated but eager to contribute.

He introduced guerrilla coaching not as a rebellion, but as an act of **intentional, strategic support**. The word "guerrilla" conjures improvised battles and hidden tactics. And yes, that spirit was there — but with purpose. We learned that the best coaches don't arrive with megaphones and metrics, but with ears and empathy.

## Watch First, Act Later

Francisco insisted: **"Don't coach what you haven't observed."** That hit me. Too many times I've seen well-intentioned interventions flop because someone pushed a solution before understanding the system. We practiced quiet observation exercises, simulating a team in action. What are they trying to accomplish? What seems to block them? What dynamics are present?

That exercise alone reminded me how rare it is to simply _watch_ before acting. Coaching de guerrilha isn't about urgency — it's about patience. You scout first, then design your move.

## Tactical Conversations

In one group activity, we paired up and role-played spontaneous coaching opportunities: hallway chats, quick syncs, coffee line conversations. It wasn't about setting up "official" retros or ceremonies. It was about building trust in liminal spaces — **being present and curious without being invasive**.

Francisco shared a key technique: always bring questions. Not "What's wrong?" but "What's one thing that frustrated you today?" Not "How can we fix this?" but "What's the smallest experiment we could try tomorrow?" These openers worked magic in the room — they broke the ice, and people opened up.

## Kaizen and Kaikaku

He also introduced us to two Japanese terms: **Kaizen** and **Kaikaku**. Kaizen represents _continuous, incremental improvement_. Kaikaku, on the other hand, means _radical, disruptive change_. Most of us default to one mode or the other. Francisco challenged us to consider **when each is appropriate**.

He told a story of a team that only did Kaizen — slowly refining, never shaking things up. They became stagnant. Then another team was constantly in Kaikaku mode — pivoting so frequently they never stabilized. The best change agents can spot when to push, and when to listen. It's not about being fast, but being _adaptive_.

## From Coaching to Cultural Shift

The workshop closed with something that will stay with me: **"Culture is what people do when no one's watching."** Francisco asked: what habits are we encouraging by what we tolerate, reward, or ignore?

This session wasn't just about coaching. It was about **systemic awareness**. You can't influence a culture without understanding it. And you won't understand it unless you slow down and care enough to learn how it breathes.

He left us with a final reflection: _"Don't try to be the hero. Be the guide. The gardener. The host."_ The room fell silent after that. Because every person in that room had, at some point, tried to be the hero — and failed.

## Quiet Power, Intentional Impact

I walked out of the room rethinking everything I'd believed about driving change. I didn't need to wait for a new title. I didn't need to install a framework. I needed to listen more, watch better, ask better questions, and commit to nudging systems gently and consistently.

This talk wasn't flashy. No fancy slides. But the content? It was gold. Practical, philosophical, and grounded in experience. **Thank you Francisco Trindade** for proving that quiet influence is not weak — it's wise.

And thank you, Agile Brazil, for putting sessions like this on the map. What a day.
