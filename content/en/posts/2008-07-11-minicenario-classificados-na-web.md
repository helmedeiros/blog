Starting this session of my blog, I will present 4 mini scenarios created during the first module of my Master's degree in Web Systems Projects, taught by Professor Osmar Fernandes Jr. **DESCRIPTION** Dalila is offering her friends from school, neighborhood, and club a web-based classified service.

Who advertises pays R$2.00 for a simple 20-word announcement or R$5.00 for a featured page announcement that can contain up to 50 words and an image.

The announcement remains available for 15 days.

Not included in the count are: the product value, title text, contact name, up to two contact phone numbers, and a note about the phone numbers (e.g. "from 6pm to 8pm").

Those who become subscribers to the virtual classified receive a daily email summary of site offers.

The customer can create sections of interest to receive new announcements via email without needing to access the site. **USE CASES** ![Diagrama Casos Uso Classificados Web][1] CLASSIFIED WEB DIAGRAM <img src="/uploads/2008/07/classificado-na-web-diagrama-de-classe.png" alt="Classified Web Diagram" height="367" width="682" />
