Giving start to this session of my blog I will present 4 mini-scenarios, created during the first module of my post-graduation in Web Systems Projects, taught by Professor Osmar Fernandes Jr.
**DESCRIPTION**
Dalila is offering friends from school, neighborhood, and club a classified service via the web.
Who advertises pays R$ 2.00 for a simple announcement of 20 words or R$5.00 for a highlighted page announcement that can contain up to 50 words and an image. The announcement will be available for 15 days. Non-counted values are product value, title text, contact name, up to two contact phone numbers and a five-word observation about the phone numbers (for example: from 18h to 20h).
Who becomes a subscriber of the virtual classified receives a daily email summary of site offers.
The client can register sections of interest to receive new announcements via email without needing to access the site.
