Agile Brazil 2011 will take place from June 27th to July 1st in Fortaleza, CE — bringing together more than 50 talks covering some of the most important global agile topics. And the best part: **I'll be there — and I'll be speaking!**

This participation feels extra special. When I lived in Natal/RN, I used to dream of attending events like this. Now, six months after moving to Porto Alegre to join Dell's services team, I'm returning to the Northeast to deliver **two lightning talks** — right near where my journey began.

### Lightning Talk – June 29

**"How do high-turnover companies actually learn?"**

In this talk, I'll explore strategies and techniques I've experienced — both as a participant and as a change agent — at companies facing high employee turnover. We'll discuss how to build a culture of continuous learning, foster knowledge sharing, and support talent retention.

Want to transform churn into **collective evolution**? Let's talk!

### Lightning Talk – June 30

**"Ramones or Jazz? Or Both? Finding Flow Through Music"**

A co-presentation with <a title="Daniel Wildt" href="http://twitter.com/#!/dwildt" target="_blank">@dwildt</a>, where we'll show how music can **enhance focus and motivation** using the **Songdoro** technique — a mashup of Pomodoro and PowerSongs. We'll show how syncing the right rhythm with the right task can seriously boost your output.

Expect real-life stories, actionable examples, and even a few collaborative playlists!

### See You There!

Throughout the conference, I'll post daily highlights from the talks and sessions that stand out. If you haven't registered yet, you still can: <a title="Inscrição para Agile Brazil 2011" href="http://submissoes.agilebrazil.com/attendees/new" target="_blank">sign up here</a>.
