This year <a title="Agile Brazil" href="http://agilebrazil.com" target="_blank">Agile Brazil</a> will take place from June 27th to July 1st in Fortaleza/CE, with over 50 talks covering most of the "must-haves" of the agile world scenario.

So that my participation in the events wouldn't be so simple, when I was in Natal/RN, I envied the distance after 6 months of moving to Porto Alegre to work alongside the _services_ team at Dell, I was accepted to present two lightning talks close to where I came from.

So let's summarize what I'll be presenting!! <figure id="attachment_359" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"> [<img class="size-full wp-image-359" src="http://www.helmed.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/banner-250.png" alt="Agile Brazil 2011" width="250" height="354" srcset="http://www.helmed.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/banner-250.png 250w, http://www.helmed.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/banner-250-211x300.png 211w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Agile Brazil 2011</figcaption></figure> **June 27th and 28th:** I'll still be in POA, but just like last year, when I could participate in these days, I say to anyone who can go that they should take advantage of the two days before the official opening of the event, because interesting courses will take place, with figures from the agile community such as <a title="Giovanni Bassi" href="http://twitter.com/#!/giovannibassi" target="_blank">@giovannibassi</a>, <a title="Heitor Roriz" href="https://twitter.com/#!/hroriz" target="_blank">@hroriz</a>, <a title="Alexandre Magno" href="http://twitter.com/#!/axmagno" target="_blank">@axmagno</a>, Christopher G.

Thompson from <a href="http://www.lean.org.br/" target="_blank">Lean Institute Brasil</a> and finally those I had the pleasure of accompanying to know about success at <a title="Agile Brazil 2010

The goal of the presentation:

Learning something takes time, I'm 25 years old and always go back to the dictionary for some words.

How do companies achieve success without worrying about their employees?

Let's mine the desires of Generation Y and debate creative solutions for creating a culture of learning, so that everyone can say… EU FICO!! **June 30th:** I'll be presenting the second lightning talk “<a href="http://www.agilebrazil.com/2011/pt/detalhes.php#lts_3" target="_blank">Ramones ou Jazz?

Ou os dois?

Buscando produtividade com músicas</a>” in partnership with <a title="Daniel Wildt" href="http://twitter.com/#!/dwildt" target="_blank">@dwildt</a>.

The goal of the presentation:

Generate concentration, seek motivation, believe that music can help find results.

All this using the Pomodoro technique in an altered rhythm, through music and the "songdoro", which mixes Pomodoro technique with the concept of powersongs.

Wait for more news during the event; I'll be posting daily about the talks and interesting topics seen at what will again be one of the biggest agile events in Brazil!!
