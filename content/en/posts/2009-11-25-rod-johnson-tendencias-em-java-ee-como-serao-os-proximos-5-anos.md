On Wednesday at **TDC Rio**, one of the most anticipated talks was from **Rod Johnson**, the creator of the Spring Framework and author of some of the most influential Java books.

His session began at 10 a.m. and tackled the topic of **change and trends** in the Java ecosystem from the perspective of someone who helped shape it.

## Cloud Computing: Distributed Power

Rod pointed to **cloud computing** as one of the major shifts redefining our relationship with infrastructure. The ability to **distribute compute power on demand** dramatically reduces the need for upfront hardware investment.

> In simple terms: with the cloud, you pay for what you use — not for idle capacity.

## Developers vs. Change-Averse Management

He joked (but not really) about the tension between **developers eager to try new tech** and **managers who fear change**. The result, according to Rod, is a kind of wall that stifles innovation just when it's gaining traction.

## The Monopolization Risk

Rod also raised concerns about **monopoly in the Java ecosystem**, warning that if a single company controls too much of the stack — from language to tools — innovation will suffer.

Referencing the then-recent **acquisition of Sun by Oracle**, he suggested a cautious approach: "Depending on one vendor for everything is dangerous."

## The Polyglot Revolution and the JVM's Role

While other languages like Ruby, Scala, and Python were gaining popularity, Rod emphasized that **Java remained the dominant language**, and more importantly, that **the JVM was the true asset**.

> "You can run Groovy, JRuby, Clojure — all on the same VM. That's power."

## Open Source as an Innovation Engine

Rod credited **open source** as the reason Spring even existed. Without it, no small team could have competed with the likes of IBM, BEA, or Oracle to build a framework.

> "Open source lowers the barrier to innovation."

Still, he warned that too much fragmentation in the open source world can confuse developers — and stressed the need for good judgment when adopting libraries and frameworks.

## Ruby on Rails and the Spring Roo Inspiration

Rod discussed how **Ruby on Rails** redefined developer productivity — not because it made code trivial, but because it emphasized **rapid feedback and smart defaults**.

Spring Source applied many of these lessons when creating **Spring Roo**, a lightweight tool to boost productivity without sacrificing clarity.

## Spring Source, VMWare, and Open Source Direction

Some in the community feared that **Spring Source's acquisition by VMWare** would affect its open source focus. But Rod reassured the audience that **VMWare was aligned with the open source mission** and would not change the community roadmap.

## Cloud Foundry and the Future

Rod wrapped up by mentioning early efforts like **Spring Source Cloud Foundry**, which would later become a leader in **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** offerings. The aim: make deployment as simple as development.

## Final Words: Brazil, It's Your Moment

Rod closed with a message to Brazilian developers:

> "Whether it's lack of awareness or access, I don't know — but this is your time. Open source is global, and it needs your voice."
