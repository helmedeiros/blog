Today we had another edition of <a title="Grupo RBS" href="http://www.gruporbs.com.br/" target="_blank">Grupo RBS</a>, where I presented along with <a title="Cintia Lima" href="https://twitter.com/cinti4lim4" target="_blank">Cintia Lima</a> the case about the challenges of launching paid content from Jornais Grupo RBS tool; a project of great importance, which like others has a varied and exploratory scope prioritized/validated, built with a newly formed team.

In the presentation, we raised points that we attribute to the good part of the success achieved, as a way to share replicable patterns in new projects with similar scenarios.

By the end, new concepts are presented that can help the success of projects that use this pattern.
