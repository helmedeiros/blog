After learning about analysis patterns to model business concepts, we now shift focus to the **structural challenges of writing software**. This is where **design patterns** shine — reusable architectural ideas that help us write cleaner, more maintainable code.

## What Is a Design Pattern?

A design pattern is a **typical, reusable solution** to a common software design problem. Think of it as a **template** or **blueprint**: it doesn't give you ready-made code, but a structured way of thinking about a recurring problem in your system.

Design patterns are **not libraries** or functions you can copy-paste. Instead, they describe **abstract relationships between classes and objects** that you can adapt to your use case.

> A pattern is to code what a blueprint is to a building: it helps you structure the solution before pouring concrete.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

Here's what makes them essential:

- **Communication**: They give teams a shared vocabulary. Saying "this is a decorator" immediately tells other developers what to expect.
- **Maintainability**: Patterns encourage loose coupling and solid principles, making code easier to evolve.
- **Reusability**: Abstracting repeated structure avoids reinventing solutions.

## What Makes Up a Pattern?

Most documented patterns include:

- **Intent**: What the pattern solves (problem + high-level idea).
- **Motivation**: When and why it's useful.
- **Structure**: UML diagrams and class interactions.
- **Code Examples**: Often shown in Java, C++, Python or TypeScript.
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs (e.g., memory use vs. flexibility).

## The Catalog of Design Patterns

The classic "Gang of Four" book classifies 23 design patterns into three categories: ["Architecture", "Technology"]

## Creational Patterns

How to create objects in a flexible, reusable way.

- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Singleton

Use when: you want to separate object construction from its representation or ensure controlled instantiation.

## Structural Patterns

How to compose objects into larger structures.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

Use when: you want to decouple implementation from interface or add behavior without inheritance.

## Behavioral Patterns

How to manage communication and responsibilities between objects.

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

Use when: you want to encapsulate algorithms, manage event propagation, or switch behavior dynamically.

## Pattern vs Algorithm

An **algorithm** is a fixed sequence of steps to solve a task (e.g., quicksort).
A **pattern** is a reusable structure that lets you decide how to build those steps in your software. You can implement a pattern in many ways.

> Cooking analogy: An algorithm is a recipe. A pattern is the idea of "baking" or "marinating."

## Conclusion

Design patterns are time-tested thinking tools. They help us go beyond just writing code — we design systems.

In upcoming posts, we'll go deeper into each category with concrete UML diagrams, when to use them, and examples that highlight trade-offs and variations.

Stay tuned for real-world applications of Factory, Strategy, Observer, and more.
