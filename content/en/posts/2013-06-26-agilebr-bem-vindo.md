The great [Manoel Pimentel][2], started working at 09:30h with the presentation of our honored guests and what they would be talking about.

Then we had the presentation of the new toys for the event, such as continuous feedback, a direct channel with the event organizing team, and suggesting #agilebr.

We have open Wi-Fi, shuttle buses for pickup and dropoff, open spaces, and other events like the startup meetup today at 19:00h at Azeite Oliva.

We will have book launches by André Faria and Rafael.

Agile Brazil is based on self-organization, with the whole team getting a standing ovation!!

That's it!

Let's start our AGILE BRAZIL!!!
