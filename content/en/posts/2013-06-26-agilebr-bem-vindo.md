Today, June 26, one of the biggest protest days of our new Brazilian change, we are gathered for the start of the largest agile methods event in the southern hemisphere.
The great Manoel Pimentel began working at 09:30h with a presentation on who would be our honored guests and what they would speak about. Then we had presentations on the new event toys like continuous feedback, direct channel with the event organizer team, and suggestion of bombarding with #agilebr.
We have open wi-fi, buses for one-way and return transportation, openspaces and other events like the startup meetup today at 19h, at Azeite de Oliva. We will have book launches by André Faria and Rafael.
Agile Brazil is based on self-organization, with the whole team getting a round of applause!!
That's it let's start OUR AGILE BRAZIL!!!
