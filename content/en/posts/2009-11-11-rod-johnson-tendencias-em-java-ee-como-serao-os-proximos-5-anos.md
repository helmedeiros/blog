Fourth day at TDC in Rio, one of the most anticipated talks is Rod Johnson's, creator of Spring and author of very interesting books. The talk started at 10:00 AM and covered changes and trends from his perspective.
To Rod, the world is going through a series of changes that lead to paradigm shifts and put us on new perspectives.
One of the first things mentioned, leading to this change, is cloud computing, which he considers one of the things driving its adoption as a trend, namely the distribution of computational power, providing economies by eliminating the need for purchasing sufficient hardware to support peaks.
For Rod, developers are attracted to new technologies day after day and they become hungry to use them and soon start incorporating them into projects managed by coordinators who hate changes... then the wall created by them is always surpassed.
A dark cloud passes over his mind and that of the community about a possible monopoly, which would cause dominance over all application codes.
A polyglot revolution is being made, however Java remains the most popular; but he believes it's stupid to say everything will end there, Java won't be the last language or one that solves all problems; on the other hand, JVM is supporting and growing with many of these languages.
To Rod, open source and how software are being developed today enable a change in address for creating the best technologies, the community transfers from the Silicon Valley to the world the task of innovating; he believes it's not possible for Spring to exist if he had to go look for IBM and etc. to launch his framework. He believes, however, that the quantity of innovations provided by open source can confuse new developers.
To him, Ruby and Rails is a good point of change where super-productivity doesn't necessarily imply that coding isn't important, but rather through lessons learned from using it as a language. Spring Source knew how to take advantage of these lessons, creating the core of spring and roo.
It was said that the acquisition of Sun should not be seen as a problem for Java, as many of Oracle's technologies maintain this company as a leader and this company would not alter that, according to him. He prefers the company not to fall under the influence of a strong company rather than being tutored by a weak one, which I found a bit complicated considering he had said that open source favors growth...
It was also mentioned about concerns over the acquisition of Spring Source by VMware should be forgotten, as this company knows the importance of open source and will continue to grow in favor of the community.
In this environment, solutions are being created to increase developer productivity and cloud computing is being viewed as a trend, such as Spring Source Cloud Foundry and Spring Roo.
The talk ended with a message, which I don't know about, but for Rod now it's time for Brazilian developers to appear, open source is global and allows that!!!
