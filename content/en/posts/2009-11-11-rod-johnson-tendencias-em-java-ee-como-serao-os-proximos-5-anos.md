The talk started at 10:00h and discussed changes and trends from his point of view.

For Rod, the world is going through a series of changes that lead to paradigm shifts and put us on new perspectives.

One of the first things mentioned, which leads to this change, is cloud computing.

For him, one of the things that makes people use and visualize this solution as a trend is the distribution of computational power, providing economies by not needing to buy sufficient equipment to handle peaks.

Developers are attracted to new technologies day after day and they get hungry for using them and start inserting them into projects managed by coordinators who hate changes... so the wall created by them is always surpassed.

A black cloud passes over Rod's mind and the community's about a possible monopoly that would cause dominance over all application codes.

A polyglot revolution is being made, but Java remains the most popular.

However, he believes it would be foolish to say that everything ends there; Java will not be the last language nor one that solves all problems; on the other hand, JVM supports and grows with many of these languages.

For Rod, open source and how software is being made today enables a change in address for creating the best technologies.

The community transfers from Silicon Valley to the world the task of innovating; he believes it wouldn't be possible for Spring to exist if he had needed to seek IBM and others to launch his framework.

However, he thinks that the amount of innovations provided by open source can confuse new developers.

For him, Ruby and Rails is a good point of change where super-productivity does not necessarily imply that coding is not important, but rather by learning from what language it's used for.

Spring Source knew how to take advantage of these lessons, creating the core of spring and roo.

It was said that the purchase of Sun shouldn't be seen as a problem for Java, because many Oracle technologies keep this company as a leader and this company wouldn't change that; according to him, he prefers a company not controlled by a strong company than under the tutelage of a weak one... .

Also mentioned were concerns about the acquisition of Spring Source by VMWare should be forgotten; in his opinion, this company knows the importance of open source and the development agenda will continue to grow for the community.

In this environment, solutions are being created to increase developer productivity and the community's behavior with cloud computing, such as <a title="cloud foundry" href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com/" target="_blank">Spring Source Cloud Foundry</a>, and Spring Roo.

The talk ended with a message...

I don't know about the unknown or what, but now is the moment for Brazilian developers to appear, open source is global and allows it!!!
