## 1. When Strategy Is Missing, Start With Shared Understanding

At times, company-level OKRs either come late, change rapidly, or simply don't exist. This can paralyze a team at the start of a new quarter. In those moments, rather than wait for strategic direction to arrive from above, we built Session #0 to help teams self-orient around customer needs, platform constraints, and business opportunities.

Session #0 isn't a replacement for company strategyâ€”it's a mechanism for alignment when that strategy is unclear. Its power lies in focusing the team on what is already known: customer pains, platform strengths and limitations, stakeholder expectations, and growth opportunities. Instead of filling a vacuum with assumptions, we fill it with collaboration.

The outcome is not a backlog. It's not a roadmap. It's clarityâ€”a single vision statement that captures what matters most for the next 90 days.

Without Session #0, teams often face predictable risks: when strategy is delayed, they start with unaligned or made-up goals; when strategy is vague, ideas compete instead of coalescing; and when strategy is unknown, execution starts with friction and confusion.

This session helped us stop spinning in circles and instead start from shared insight.

## Session Overview

**Total Duration:** 30 minutes
**Participants:** 4-8 team members
**Materials:** Collaboration board (Miro/Figma), sticky notes, voting dots

| Activity                | Duration | Purpose                                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Share Known Inputs      | 15 min   | Gather stakeholder insights and team pain points to form foundation |
| Group & Vote            | 5 min    | Prioritize the most impactful ideas for the quarter                 |
| Define Vision Statement | 10 min   | Collaboratively create shared vision for the quarter                |

## 2. The Vision Template: Five Angles of Exploration

We created a structured canvas to help teams map and prioritize what they already knew. The canvas isn't staticâ€”it's collaborative. It includes five key areas:

1. **Customer Known Pains**
2. **Customer Known Gains**
3. **Business Opportunities**
4. **Stakeholder Expectations**
5. **Platform Known Constraints and Strengths**

Each area contains sticky notes where team members add facts, feedback, signals, or known blockers. The idea is not to brainstorm blindlyâ€”but to gather what we already understand from user research, analytics, interviews, retrospectives, and incidents.

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ customer-gains.md

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stakeholder-expectations.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ platform-notes.md
```

This process helps reduce opinion-based debates and raise the visibility of common themes across functions.

## 3. Facilitation Techniques to Shape Contributions

Different moments of the workshop require different styles of participation. We often fall into the trap of thinking alignment means everyone talking at once, but the most productive sessions use varied techniques to draw out input.

Here are a few facilitation modes we've used during Session #0:

| Technique               | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Divide and Conquer      | Speed up parallel input capture                         |
| Fishbowl Conversation   | Focused discussion, limited number of active speakers   |
| Person in the Spotlight | Let one person explain, others ask clarifying questions |
| Tell and Cluster        | Group similar ideas to expose patterns                  |
| Individual Brainstorm   | Minimize anchoring bias                                 |
| Voting                  | Prioritize without over-discussing each item            |

You don't need to use all techniques. But picking the right one for each activity reduces groupthink and increases signal.

## 4. Step-by-Step Instructions for the Session

The way we facilitate Session #0 often looks like this:

1. **Split into two subgroups**. Each group is responsible for half the canvas (e.g., pains/gains vs. stakeholders/platform).
2. **Tell and Cluster**. Participants read out their notes, and others group them into visible clusters.
3. **Voting round**. Each person gets a limited number of votes to prioritize the most important pains/gains/opportunities.
4. **Vision Statement Writing**. As a group, we write one clear sentence: "This quarter, we will [do what] in order to [drive which outcome] for [which users or teams]."

```markdown
Vision: Empower players to reliably organize and join football matches with confidence, by launching core features that reduce friction, increase trust, and build community-driven growth.
```

It's not about writing a perfect sentenceâ€”it's about summarizing what matters most, together.

## 5. Why Session #0 Pays Off

Session #0 doesn't produce a roadmap. It creates context. It's the difference between being handed OKRs vs. shaping what the OKRs should be about. And even when company OKRs do exist, Session #0 helps validate whether team execution will actually contribute meaningfully to them.

We've seen teams:

- Align faster on what _not_ to do
- Build better OKRs in Session #1
- Spot blockers (like platform gaps) early
- Give stakeholders more confidence in their focus

OKRA doesn't skip the messy part. It uses it. And Session #0 is where that mess starts to make sense.
