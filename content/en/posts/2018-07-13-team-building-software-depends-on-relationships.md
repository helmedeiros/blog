We often ask ourselves:

> What defines a good product?
> A good team?
> Or just… success?

In this keynote, I brought a simple but hard-earned truth: **software is not just code—it's built on relationships**.

Too often, organizations obsess over data, information, and process automation. But what truly sustains software delivery is wisdom—and wisdom emerges from people connecting, understanding, and growing together.

## What I Saw, What I Lived

This wasn't a talk filled with buzzwords or idealistic frameworks. I shared what I've _seen_ and _lived_ while building teams and products over the years. I've been part of teams that worked, and teams that didn't. The difference wasn't in tech stacks—it was in **connection**.

We crave love. But love—real connection at work—takes time.

## Practices That Build Real Teams

I shared practical activities we've used to build strong teams across multiple companies and contexts. Each activity is a lever—not magic, but structure—for building connection, trust, and shared purpose.

### Team Vision Exercise

To align our identity and purpose, we ask:

```
FOR: (the organization)
THAT: (has a need or opportunity)
THE: (team name) is a: (type of team)
THAT: (exists to achieve X)
UNLIKE: (other alternatives)
OUR TEAM: (has this key differentiator)
```

**Why**: This activity gives clarity about why the team exists and how it's different from other parts of the org.
**How**: Bring the team together in a safe space and co-create the answers collaboratively.
**Impact**: Creates ownership, reinforces purpose, and reduces the feeling of "just executing tickets."

### Expectation Matrix

Before we align on tools or processes, we need to align on **expectations**. Each role—Dev, QA, PO, BA—lists their current state and where they want to go. Example:

```
FROM: Testing after dev is done
TO: Collaborative test case writing in refinement
```

**Why**: Misaligned expectations are the silent killer of collaboration.
**How**: Use a whiteboard or Miro board and go role by role. Encourage reflection and open discussion.
**Impact**: Improves role clarity, reveals bottlenecks, and builds respect for each other's responsibilities.

### Team Principles

You can't build shared responsibility without **shared principles**. Here, we write down:

- Preferred communication methods (Slack, email, meetings?)
- Meeting structure (what, when, why)
- Availability and boundaries (on-call, async, remote days)
- Conflict resolution norms

**Why**: Default behavior is based on assumptions. Principles make expectations explicit.
**How**: Co-create a living document during a working session or retro.
**Impact**: Reduces misunderstandings, increases psychological safety, and shortens feedback loops.

### Games for Connection – The Candy Game

Each color corresponds to a personal or work-related prompt. Participants pick a candy and share:

- Red: What you love about your job
- Yellow: A life goal you're working on
- Green: Something you want to learn
- Purple: How you regain focus
- Blue: A stressful work aspect
- Orange: Your favorite food

**Why**: Work becomes real when people bring their full selves.
**How**: Use colored candy (M&Ms or jelly beans) and explain each color.
**Impact**: Breaks silos, reveals shared interests, and humanizes teammates.

### Lunch & Happy Hours

There's no substitute for informal time together.
**Lunch is part of the job.** Happy hours are more than perks—they're connection time.

**Why**: Teams aren't built in standups.
**How**: Create rituals—weekly team lunch, monthly after-work drink.
**Impact**: Builds belonging and trust, especially for remote or hybrid teams.

## Structure Reflects Communication

> _Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure._ — Conway's Law

Your codebase and your org chart are reflections of how (and how well) people talk to each other. Make that communication intentional.

## Closing Thought

> "Value in software is created not just by what people know or do—but by what they can achieve together."

Team building is not a side activity. It _is_ the activity.
And **relationships are not fluff—they are infrastructure**.
