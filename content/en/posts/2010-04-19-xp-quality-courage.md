In the twelfth Software Engineering lecture at Universidade Potiguar (UnP), we explored an approach that's both deeply practical and philosophically bold: **Extreme Programming (XP)**. This session challenged the habits that lead to rushed, brittle software — and reframed agility through a lens of quality, responsibility, and courage.

## Fragile Scrum, Risky Quality

We began with a hard truth: many teams practice Scrum but still ship low-quality code. They skip technical practices, accumulate debt, ignore tests. XP rises as a counter-response — not through more meetings, but with concrete, grounded practices.

XP isn't "yet another methodology." It's a mindset, a toolkit, and a protest against superficial agility. The point is clear: don't talk about speed unless you're committed to quality.

## Episodes That Mirror Real Life

We presented a sequence of "XP Episodes" through visuals and short scenarios — a developer asking for help and getting it; a failing test that sparks discussion; a class needing refactor before it grows. All of it inside short, validated cycles.

Students acted out these scenes in pairs — paper and pen in hand, one as the coder, one as the reviewer. This hands-on "improvised pair programming" exposed that great technical practices are behavioral first, technical second.

Facilitators can use this activity in team training to boost empathy, active listening, and a shared commitment to starting with tests, not ending with them.

## Economics and the True Value of Software

We spent time discussing the **economic value of well-crafted code**. XP helps reduce waste and builds adaptability into the product. Students reflected on real-world decisions: whether to pivot, grow, kill, or refactor.

XP manages risk through fast feedback and small, frequent deliveries. Every iteration is a learning opportunity. Every unused feature is a cost avoided. We taught that "not building" can be the smartest engineering decision.

## Values That Hold It All Together

XP rests on four values: **Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, and Courage** — with **Respect** emerging as a vital fifth.

We unpacked each one. Communication isn't a tool; it's availability. Simplicity means letting go of false certainty. Feedback requires deep listening. Courage isn't heroism — it's a team's shared conviction to do the right thing. And respect is the glue that keeps it together.

Students were asked to identify where these values showed up in their own academic or work experiences. The discussion was personal, honest, and rich. Instructors can use this as a deep listening activity — a round-table format that builds psychological safety and trust.
