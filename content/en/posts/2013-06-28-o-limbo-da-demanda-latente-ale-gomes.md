Here is the translation of the Portuguese text to English, keeping all __PLACEHOLDER__ text exactly as written:

The Alê started by presenting himself and positioning himself as unworthy of being the keynote speaker at this great event, and began defining everyone else involved in the community's growth. To him, it's not just about electing a committee to represent and fight for everyone's interests once many voices are crying out at the same time.

Agile Brazil has been going well, and that happens when the group's interest represents its representatives! The problem is that in many cases, it seems like our political representatives are prioritizing their own interests above those of their constituents.

To Alê, what we're living through in Brazilian politics has everything to do with what we're seeking in Agile Brazil. The government delivers value to the people and the people give feedback to the customer; agile methods aim for that, where the team delivers value to the customer and the customer gives feedbacks to the team so that they can continue iteratively improving.

Agile methods seek short feedback cycles, and we know the advantages of this. When we think about politics, however, with 4-year cycles, we have desires and at the end, there's a huge distance between these. If agile enthusiasts were consulted to change or correct this problem, we would have shorter cycles, daily meetings, pulled systems, and feedback - but we're not seeing this happen in the public sphere.

Alê invited everyone at this moment to participate in social control mass, because only then with everyone's constant feedbacks can they provide betterments.

We must always maintain high the premise set by [Ash Maurya][1] that "Life is too short to create something no one wants." The high administration of public institutions doesn't create any relationship of motivation or connection with the business area - this has changed. The TCU made a ruling in 2010 (2308/2010-TCU-Plenario). They're now provoking changes, defining that all objectives must be followed and measured, and all these ideas are common... aren't they?

The problem seems to be not spending money, but how it's being used. If we think that agile practices can improve our government, the question is: will the government be able to have the customer alongside? Alê thought that Brazilian inertia wouldn't promote this change until the last month.

There are currently large initiatives, such as <a title="Para onde foi o meu dinheiro" href="http://www.paraondefoiomeudinheiro.com.br/dataset/estado-sao-paulo-2012" target="_blank">para onde foi o meu dinheiro</a>, which facilitates debate on Brazilian issues; <a title="Para onde foi meu voto" href="http://paraondefoimeuvoto.com.br/" target="_blank">o para onde foi meu voto</a>, which shows where most of your money goes; <a title="Deputados Analytics" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Deputados-Analytics/152773858104734" target="_blank">o deputados analytics</a>, which shows what were the main efforts of politicians; <a title="Cuidando do meu bairro" href="http://br.okfn.org/2012/07/04/cuidando-do-meu-bairro/" target="_blank">o cuidando bem do meu bairro</a>, which reunites information about presences in plenary and others; <a title="open copa" href="http://opencopa.com/" target="_blank">open copa</a>, which allows for monitoring of Cup financing data, and many other applications with some or various public data. And these forms of social control tend to position customers closer to government.

There is currently this desire for change, this interest in shortening feedback cycles so that we can exercise our citizenship even more. Alê proposes going to our squares, regional and global webs, to fight or instigate the changes and future we want to exist. The digital citizen is one of these activities that focuses on allowing project proposals through electronic signatures, as per PL 6928/2002 and PR 68/2011, trying to give legitimacy to digital, so that the voices of these squares can be heard, and changes and transformations are possible.

The problem we're facing today in the public sphere is the same one we've been experiencing for years in software projects, and just like agile methods, we need to get out of the buildings, discover who the groups and customers are with customer discovery, and work in their favor. Estonia is doing this; the state wants to be the facilitator of the people.

The biggest problem in Brazil isn't technological - being or not using Java or Ruby; it's not about contracting methods and sim is about which software should be made. We need to think about Agile Brazil beyond just making something work directly for what needs to be done! So Alê adds that we need more than software functioning - we need the right software!!

Applauded standing up, the message remains: let's change the country!
