> **Series: Caelum Day 2009** | **Introduction** > _Comprehensive coverage of cutting-edge talks from Rio's premier Java event_

I just left the event and I'm still digesting everything that happened this sunny Saturday at Estácio's campus in Rio. **Caelum Day** was intense, well-organized, and full of relevant content delivered by people who clearly live and breathe technology.

The talks were deep but accessible. We covered **Cloud Computing, REST, NoSQL, Java, Flex**, and more. What stood out was how every session stayed grounded in real practice — with examples, lived experiences, and even some honest critiques.

## Why It's Worth Writing Down

Whenever I attend events like this, I leave with a notebook full of ideas. This time, I'm doing something different: I'll publish a **series of posts**, one for each of the talks that stood out the most.

The goal isn't to transcribe them, but to share **what I learned, what challenged my thinking, and how those topics connect to what we do today in the tech world**.
