**In the fourth Software Engineering lecture** at Universidade Potiguar (UnP), we explored evolutionary and incremental models, focusing on adaptation, exploration, and software reuse. The goal wasn't to memorize frameworks, but to understand how to respond to change intelligently.

## When the plan needs to change

We opened with a provocative question: what can go wrong in a software project? The honest answer — almost everything: scope, requirements, people, timing, priorities.

We talked about how rigid processes fail when faced with unpredictability. I introduced the concept of **evolutionary models**, which rely on short cycles, constant validation, and early delivery of value. These models help ensure the product remains relevant even as the environment rapidly changes.

## Activity: Prototyping with ambiguity

I asked students to imagine a digital product with unclear requirements. In groups, they sketched quick interface prototypes and shared questions that emerged during the process.

This activity works well in product teams too — aligning expectations across design, engineering, and business. The focus isn't creating the perfect design, but surfacing what we _don't_ yet understand, so we can test and iterate sooner.

## CBSE: Reuse to go further

The second part of the class covered Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE). We discussed how reusing software can reduce costs, improve quality, and speed up delivery. I walked through the process: component analysis, requirement adaptation, reuse-centric design, and integration.

We also examined risks. Off-the-shelf products can come with performance limitations, poor support, or unexpected updates. Still, knowing how to evaluate, adapt, and integrate existing components is a crucial skill for today's developers.

## Reusability with product thinking

We explored examples of product lines — shared architectures generating multiple solutions with controlled variation. ERP systems and invoicing platforms served as practical analogies. Reuse isn't about copy-pasting — it's about **designing for flexibility with intent**.

It's worth stressing: reuse takes investment. It's a strategic decision, not a shortcut. For teams and instructors introducing this approach, it's essential to cover topics like modularity, interface contracts, and planned evolution.

## Iterative models and the spiral

Toward the end of the lecture, we looked at iterative models and Barry Boehm's spiral model. These models embrace short cycles, continuous prototyping, and incremental learning.

I demonstrated how to apply the spiral model in agile teams: each iteration involves planning, risk analysis, prototyping, and validation. Complexity is managed through learning. With visual examples, I emphasized that **progress doesn't require a straight line** — sometimes the best path forward curves.

## Putting it into practice

For educators or facilitators, this session can be adapted to any learning or team environment. Choose an open-ended problem, encourage fast iteration cycles, and treat mistakes as stepping stones. The most valuable outcome is fostering curiosity, feedback, and continuous growth.
