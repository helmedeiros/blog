**In the tenth lecture** of the Software Engineering course at Universidade Potiguar (UnP), we focused on the concrete application of **Extreme Programming (XP)**. We moved beyond theory and into the daily rhythm of teams: management, workspace, planning, development, design, and testing. XP stopped being just a set of practices—it became a survival strategy for delivering real-world software.

## Managing with Principles, Not Titles

We began by examining how XP views management. Instead of rigid hierarchies or "everyone does everything," XP favors leadership through principles: assumed responsibility, commitment to quality, incremental change, and local adaptation. The goal isn't to command but to support flow.

We looked at visual examples of team dashboards and discussed the idea of "traveling light" — removing activities that consume effort but deliver little value. Students reflected on how simple, visual, and transparent metrics often provide more clarity than bulky reports.

## Roles Beyond the Manager: Coach and Tracker

Two distinct roles came into focus: the **Coach** and the **Tracker**. The coach works closely with new developers, guides refactoring, and explains the process. The tracker monitors what was planned vs. what was delivered, without interrupting the team's flow.

I proposed an activity where students formed trios—one acting as manager, one as coach, and one as tracker. Each had to list concrete actions they would take to improve delivery quality without overwhelming the team. This generated rich conversation about how XP spreads ownership.

Teams in companies can use this exercise to support distributed leadership and identify strengths and gaps in their delivery approach.

## The Space Communicates: Environmental Strategy

We then explored how workspace design influences team behavior. We contrasted isolated spaces (closed offices) with overly open ones (no privacy). XP encourages a balance: common areas for connection and private spots for focus.

I presented XP layout diagrams with clear space zoning. The principle of **courage** appeared here—changing your workspace signals deeper cultural change. A space must invite pair programming, encourage fast feedback, and reduce friction in collaboration.

For leaders, this is a reminder that your floor plan says more about your culture than your mission statement.

## Planning, Coding, Designing, and Testing: A Complete Delivery Cycle

The final portion of the lecture covered tactical strategies: iterative planning, coding with simplicity, and continuous testing as a foundation for trust. XP teaches that plans evolve as we learn, readable code precedes optimized code, and tests shape design.

I asked groups to draw their "ideal delivery cycle" using XP practices. The diversity in their diagrams reflected unique perceptions of risk, cadence, and design. The discussion that followed highlighted how context determines the right blend of practices.

Facilitators can adapt this exercise for teams looking to revisit or redesign their own delivery cycles with agility in mind.
