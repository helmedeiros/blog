In our thirteenth Software Engineering lecture at Universidade Potiguar (UnP), we returned to **Extreme Programming (XP)** to go deeper—not just into what it is, but why it works. This session expanded beyond mechanics into mindset, exploring the principles that make XP sustainable and the practices that make it powerful.

## From Principles to Purpose

We began with principles. Concepts like rapid feedback, presumed simplicity, small changes, and embracing change anchored our discussion. We challenged the idea that "big changes mean progress." Instead, we asked: _How do we evolve software in safe, consistent steps without breaking everything?_

Students reflected on Kent Beck's assertion: "The best strategy preserves the most options while solving the most urgent problem." This led to a short written activity where they identified "the last big change" in a project they were part of—and how it could've been broken into safer increments.

This exercise can be replicated in any engineering team or classroom. The outcome? Greater awareness of when we're overengineering under uncertainty.

## Beyond Practice: A Culture of Quality

We then explored other key XP principles: local adaptation, honest communication, minimal up-front investment, and metrics that truly reflect value. The classroom responded to these with examples from past internships, where big up-front specs or vague KPIs created rework and disappointment.

We emphasized that XP isn't a list of practices; it's a culture. You don't adopt XP by implementing standups. You adopt XP when your team truly values simplicity, feedback, and shared responsibility.

## Practices That Build Trust

We transitioned to practices: planning games, continuous integration, refactoring, pair programming, simple design, and 40-hour work weeks. Each was broken down using real examples and images. We discussed how planning splits across business and development roles, and how collective code ownership supports learning.

One of the key activities was a live estimation game. Students formed pairs, received mock user stories, and had to estimate size, scope, and risk. The reflection after this game was more valuable than the estimates—most students underestimated risk and overestimated speed.

This game works well in product teams or code schools to trigger valuable conversations about tradeoffs, uncertainty, and scope.

## Refactor to Survive

Another important practice we unpacked was refactoring. I asked the class: "When was the last time you refactored before adding a feature, not after?" This sparked discussion about how hard it is to pause and improve when the deadline's approaching—but how often that small refactor would have made the task easier.

We framed refactoring as **preparation, not cleanup**, and used a board activity where students picked one of their projects and planned out small refactorings that could unlock growth.

## The Power of Overlapping Practices

We closed with a synthesis of everything: how XP practices overlap to reinforce each other. If planning falls short, testing can expose risk. If pairing fails, collective ownership catches the gap. If code is simple, refactoring becomes natural. These synergies are why XP isn't about isolated tools—but about building a **resilient system**.

Students left understanding that XP is not hard to explain, but it's hard to stick with. That's where commitment, culture, and courage come in.
