> **Series: Life in Porto Alegre** | **Part 2 of 7** > _Discovering a new city and a new career_

There's something quietly powerful about hitting a rhythm. That flow where your mind stops wandering, distractions fade away, and you're fully committed to one thing: delivering excellent work. That was my December at Dell.

### Pomodoro for Deep Work

Migrating legacy services isn't glamorous — it's gritty, intricate, and often filled with subtle traps. In November, I found myself deep into one of these migrations. The domain was new, the stakes were high, and the layers of technology made it a mental marathon. But the strategy that helped me most was **time-blocked focus**. I turned to **Pomodoro Technique** — 25-minute bursts of concentration, followed by short breaks.

Pomodoro helped me **respect complexity without being overwhelmed** by it. By splitting my work into focused intervals, I tackled massive migrations incrementally, validating one change at a time. No rushing, no half-done code — just progress with purpose.

### Coaching Makes the Difference

None of this happened in isolation. I had amazing support from my manager, **Eduardo Mathias**, who kept our priorities sharp, and always encouraged clarity over rush. And our tech lead, **Carlos Eduardo Maciel**, did what great tech leads do best: asked the right questions, coached through design decisions, and modeled the discipline of shipping well-tested code.

Their mentorship helped me level up. The right conversations at the right time made it easier to make decisions — and gave me room to grow.

### Small Commits and Safe Speed

Another technique that worked wonders: **small, frequent commits**. Every isolated improvement made code review easier, testing safer, and tracking progress transparent. Combined with a **balanced test pyramid** — from fast-running unit tests to occasional integration checks — I could ship confidently.

```java
// Example of a small, safe change
if (user.hasPermission("EXPORT")) {
    exporter.export(user.getData());
}
```

No drama, no regression, no firefighting. Just reliable movement forward.

### Lessons I'm Keeping

After 1.5 months at Dell, I can say this: fast doesn't mean careless. It means methodical, supported, and deliberate. It means creating a safe environment for quality to emerge naturally — with tools, habits, and people that raise the bar every day.

If you're facing your own complex project, I highly recommend:

- Try **Pomodoro** for focused blocks
- Push **small commits** frequently
- Rely on a **test pyramid** that protects your flow
- And if you're lucky like me, learn from people like Matias and Cadu.

Let's build software that lasts — and enjoy the process while we do it.
