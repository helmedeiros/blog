## Why We Created the OKRA Framework

Since Q3 of 2022, Pernelle and I have been refining a method to define OKRs that isn't top-down, opaque, or ignored by the end of week two. The method, which we now call the OKRA (OKR Agreement) framework, was born from a simple belief: people commit to what they help build. What started as a practical workaround to poorly aligned quarterly kickoffs turned into a repeatable process that's now core to how our team works.

We were tired of the false dichotomy between "alignment" and "autonomy." We wanted both. We needed both. And over time, we found that our structured, step-by-step process actually made tough trade-offs easier and gave people a clear role in shaping our direction. This post is an invitation to try it for yourself.

If you're a tech lead, product manager, or engineering manager looking to move from performative OKRs to impactful, co-owned goals, this post is for you. In this first article, I'll introduce the process, walk through the purpose and output of each session, and give you the templates we use.

## The Five-Session Process Overview

The OKRA process is built around five collaborative sessions. Each one is designed to produce a specific output, progressively transforming abstract ideas into executable goals.

| Session                              | When to Use It                      | Outcome                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Session #0: Vision & Ideation        | When company-level OKRs are unclear | Shared team vision and prioritization of themes          |
| Session #1: OKRs Ideation            | When company OKRs are known         | Draft team-level OKRs linked to company goals            |
| Session #2: Milestones Brainstorming | After drafting OKRs                 | Milestones, epics, and spikes to validate key results    |
| Session #3: OKR Finalization         | Before execution begins             | Team- and stakeholder-approved OKRs                      |
| Session #4: Execution Planning       | After OKRs are finalized            | A roadmap with clear owners, estimates, and dependencies |

Let's now break down each one.

## Session #0: Vision & Ideation (Optional but Powerful)

This is the most misunderstood session in our process, and yet it's the most transformative when done right. We run it when company-level strategy is unclear, late, or misaligned with our reality. Rather than waiting for answers, we gather known inputs: customer pains, product gaps, tech opportunities, and unmet stakeholder expectations.

We use visual templates to organize contributions under five lenses:

- Customer Pains
- Customer Gains
- Business Opportunities
- Stakeholder Expectations
- Platform Constraints or Leverage

The team then votes on what resonates most. These aren't yet objectives—they're raw themes of impact. From these, we co-create a vision statement for the quarter. This vision isn't for branding; it's for alignment. It helps us say no to distractions later.

When this session is skipped, teams tend to mimic previous quarters or defer too heavily to management for guidance. When we include it, even skeptical engineers leave energized, having seen their daily pain points translated into strategic direction.

### Sample Vision Statement:

> "This quarter, we will reduce payment friction for our cross-border users while laying the technical foundation for dynamic service fees."

## Session #1: Vision and OKRs Ideation

Assuming the company OKRs are clear, this session focuses on drafting team-level OKRs that contribute meaningfully. First, we revisit company goals. We don't just read them out—we ask, "What can we actually influence here?" This framing moves us from strategy theater to grounded discussions.

Next, we inventory the features, services, or platforms our team owns. Many teams fail here: they either forget legacy components or over-promise on systems they don't control. We map each feature to potential contributions.

Then comes the OKR writestorm. Everyone writes as many ideas as possible in silence—quantity over quality. Later, we group, merge, and refine them.

**During the session we reflect on:**

- Which customer pain/gain this idea solves?
- Which company objective it supports?
- What hypothesis we're testing?
- How will we know if it worked?

We close the session with voting. The top-voted OKRs form our draft.

### Example Table: Writestorm Template Fields

| Field              | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Idea               | Initial OKR proposal (Objective + Key Results) |
| Customer Pain/Gain | What does it improve?                          |
| Metric or Proxy    | How we measure impact                          |
| Hypothesis         | Why we believe it matters                      |
| Alignment          | Which company OKR it supports                  |

## Session #2: Milestones Brainstorming

Now that we have our draft OKRs, it's time to deconstruct them into tangible work. This is where most teams fall into the trap of "goals with no glue." Good OKRs are inspiring, but without clear initiatives, they become vague aspirations.

We break into groups, each taking one OKR. For 20 minutes, they brainstorm and map:

- Milestones: critical delivery check-points
- Epics: bundles of work tied to user value
- Spikes: knowledge-gathering investigations
- Experiments: safe-to-fail tests that validate risky assumptions

We capture them visually using templates with three horizontal lanes (Objectives) and vertical columns (time or phases).

The magic here is focus. We encourage the group to choose _what not to do_ as clearly as what to do. We ask: "If we only delivered these three initiatives, would we still move the needle on this OKR?"

We close the session by reviewing and refining. The team prunes vague ideas and consolidates similar items. At the end, we've got a clean map of how the quarter could unfold.

## Why It Works: Autonomy Meets Accountability

We don't run OKRA because it's trendy. We run it because:

- Engineers want to work on things that matter, not just what's handed down.
- PMs want shared ownership instead of pushing alignment week after week.
- Leaders want fewer surprises and clearer delivery focus.

By involving everyone early, we create clarity, commitment, and context.

**Key Benefits:**

- OKRs are not only understood—they're co-owned.
- Delivery is easier to track because milestones are linked to intent.
- Trade-offs are less painful because the team helped make them.

This framework also builds trust. When your vision includes engineers' input and your metrics reflect real constraints, people step up. You stop hearing "Why are we doing this?" and start hearing "When can we start?"

## What's Next?

In the next article, I'll walk you through how to **facilitate each session**—down to the prompts, visuals, and common pitfalls. You'll get:

- Facilitator checklists
- Screenshot-ready templates
- Troubleshooting tips when momentum drops

This isn't a process to sell. It's a process to adopt, adapt, and improve with your team.

Until then, here's your call to action:

- Invite your team to reflect on last quarter's OKRs.
- Run Session #0 or #1 before the next sprint kickoff.
- Share your outcomes. We'd love to see how you make it your own.
