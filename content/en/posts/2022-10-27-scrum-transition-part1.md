> **Series: Kanban to Scrum Transition** | **Part 1 of 4** | _Documenting our team's structured evolution from Kanban to Scrum_

## Introduction

By late 2022, our team had been using a well-structured **Kanban system** for over a year. We had weekly planning, defined WIP limits, a solid cumulative flow analysis practice, and well-managed pull-based delivery. It worked — until it didn't.

This post kicks off a four-part series documenting our transition from Kanban to Scrum. It's a reflection on what wasn't working, why we decided to change, and how we brought the team along in an intentional, structured, and empowering transformation process.

## The Pandemic Context and "Keep the Lights On"

Our Kanban approach had emerged during the pandemic, when long-term planning felt almost irrelevant. Everything was uncertain — market demand, feature scope, even team availability. So we focused on flow, prioritizing just-in-time decisions and reactive prioritization. It helped us stay afloat during ambiguity.

As the company entered a phase of financial prudence — a mode we called "keep the lights on" — we reduced experimentation and focused on stability and cross-team efficiency. This shift amplified our dependencies and exposed coordination gaps that Kanban alone couldn't cover well.

## The Signs of Inefficiency

In our retrospectives, we started to see post-its like:

- "We keep picking stories without full scope — refinement is happening too late."
- "We're working on too many things at once, and nothing is finishing."
- "It's hard to align across teams — meetings always feel reactive."
- "Not sure who's owning the delivery of this initiative."
- "We don't really know what's DONE — DoD is just informal."

These aren't signs of people underperforming — they're symptoms of **process mismatches**. Kanban gave us flexibility, but it lacked the rhythm and ritual we needed for shared learning and ownership.

## What Kanban Gave Us (and Where It Fell Short)

Kanban gave us a great base:

- A culture of **visualizing work**.
- **Flow-based thinking** and reduction of context switching.
- Comfort with **slack communication** and async progress.
- Tech debt rituals like the **tech wall**, with effort/impact matrices.
- Collaborative brainstorming and **Lean Inception** on FigJam.
- Thoughtful planning through OKRs and biweekly syncs.
- A steady **agile retrospective** practice and monthly team health radar.

But we lacked cadence. We lacked checkpoints that forced alignment before starting work. And we lacked a shared language around _how_ we deliver — especially when priorities came from outside our team.

## The Push Toward Scrum

Scrum offered what we were missing:

- **Planning as a ceremony**, not just an async doc.
- **Sprint goals** to focus our energy.
- **Definition of Ready** and **Definition of Done** to clarify handovers.
- **Sprint reviews** to reflect, celebrate, and engage stakeholders.
- A shared model of **continuous improvement via fixed retros**.
- Clear accountability on who facilitates and owns ceremonies.

These weren't just rituals. They were boundaries — spaces where clarity is built. Where leadership is distributed. Where teams pause, reflect, and recalibrate.

## A Call to Change

So we made a decision. Not out of frustration, but out of maturity. We weren't abandoning Kanban. We were **evolving toward a structure** that could help us collaborate better, manage dependencies, and build autonomy with stronger alignment.

Our next steps were clear: define our goals, align our metrics, build a shared understanding of Scrum, and coach each other into new roles.

And that's exactly what Part 2 is about.
