"Today was an amazing day at the Caelum event in Rio de Janeiro! The conference started with a presentation by Fábio Kung on cloud computing, which was very informative and engaging.

Next, Rafael Martinelli gave a talk on his experiences using Flex in companies and cases of DClick, which really sparked some interesting discussions during lunch.

After lunch, Sergio Junior and Luiz Costa presented an animated and spontaneous introduction to RESTFUL, which was a great way to showcase something that's not entirely new.

The afternoon session started with Caue Guerra's presentation on the state of Ruby on Rails in Brazil. It was like a continuation of his article from 2009, showing all the signs and evidence that Ruby on Rails has gone beyond being just a trend and is now a reality.

As usual, the Caelum team did an amazing job with their coffee breaks! I spent a month in São Paulo in 2008 and those coffee breaks were something else...

After the coffee break, we had two presentations related to databases: one on ORM frameworks by Paulo Silveira, followed by Nico Steppat's talk on NoSQL (not only SQL) and how it has changed things.

The event ended with a raffle of some great prizes... I'm sure many people must have been thrilled to win the Nintendo Wii, but I was happy to receive one year of hosting and a domain from localweb, as well as a t-shirt and notebook from ThoughtWorks.

So, all those who attended or didn't attend but want more information about the event should comment below and let's see how far our memory can take us... Thank you to the presenters for always making it worth the investment of another trip from the northeast to the south. Caelum, congratulations on yet another great show in Rio or São Paulo!"
