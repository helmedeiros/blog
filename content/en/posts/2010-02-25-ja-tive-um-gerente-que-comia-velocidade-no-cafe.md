I've been observing for a long time now the various forms used by team managers I've worked with to track my productivity and that of other team members.

Some take a lot of time analyzing mysterious <a title="Pontos por função" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_point" target="_blank">pontos de função</a>, others only look at <a title="Linhas Código" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code" target="_blank">linhas de código</a>, and only a few, perhaps the most interesting ones, see the number of delivered features in the way that satisfies our client iteration by iteration.

In Scrum, there's an interesting concept to help teams with their estimates, abstracting away complex and elaborate forecasting practices used in many teams, requiring a bit more interaction between developers and clients.

The planning poker is based on experiences, communication, and why not a little fun to determine how complex something can be.

This metric associated with our team's velocity helps us say how much software we can deliver to the client.

I've seen many satisfied customers with the deliveries, those who you cross the street without needing to change your sidewalk, and even with repetitive deliveries iteration by iteration, my manager was still eating away at our velocity early in the morning, over coffee.

Apparently, success didn't matter much if there was space to push more tasks

 - that's exactly what he wanted.

Knowing your team's <a title="Good Velocity" href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/05/Good-Velocity" target="_blank">velocidade ideal</a> and above all how you can work it is really a gift.

I don't need to say that when pressure increases, a team can literally change their feet for hands, and where the task of estimating becomes a game justifying why we're not increasing our velocity day after day.

Just looking at numbers and graphs can sometimes make you lose sight of what's most important: always delivering more and more product than the client needs!!
