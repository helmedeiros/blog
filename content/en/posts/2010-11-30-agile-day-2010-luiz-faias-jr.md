<figure> The development of professionals and companies requires continuous learning.

At Bluesoft, we are committed to fostering an environment that encourages learning and growth.

One way to achieve this is by creating a library with a wide range of physical and virtual books, so everyone has access.

To stimulate reading and sharing knowledge, we have created an online bookshelf with <a title="http://safaribookshelf.com/ " href="http://safaribookshelf.com/" target="_blank">http://safaribookshelf.com/ </a> ($22.99 for 10 books per month), <a title="http://www.audible.com/" href="http://www.audible.com/" target="_blank">http://www.audible.com/</a> ($22.95 for two audiobooks per month), <a title="http://peepcode.com/" href="http://peepcode.com/" target="_blank">http://peepcode.com/</a> ($12 for one screencast or $199 for all screencasts per year), <a title="http://railscasts.com/" href="http://railscasts.com/" target="_blank">http://railscasts.com/</a> (free), and <a title="GUJ" href="http://www.guj.com.br/" target="_blank">Guj</a>.

We also have groups of reading or studying, whether each person reads their own or everyone reads the same; paired programming; dojos...

The important thing is to discuss and learn!

Islands of knowledge never!

The best way to learn is by doing!

So, after you listen to many podcasts, make your own!

After you read a blog, create your own!

Participate in events, but sharing what you learned with others is even better!

This process also makes everyone improve their attention, as they will have to teach!

Participate in communities!

We have already gained a lot from our daily communities and I think we should give something back.

Let's move the machine!

Everyone helps us grow, and we do what in return?

Join <a title="GUJ" href="http://www.guj.com.br/" target="_blank">Guj</a> and ask questions instead of giving answers so that good documents are generated, contribute intellectually or financially to WikiPedia, or commit to some framework.

Planning and retrospectives.

For Luiz, growth involves the whole team and not just working for him.

It's like coaching, not teaching!

Yokotem, everyone should seek a way of development; all seeds are equal in their origin, but they can become different trees.

Everything must be understood and improved, not just copied!

You have to understand the principles and not just the practices!

The ritual of the black cat was mentioned, sometimes we repeat some practices without knowing why, so it's pointless to tie up a cat that didn't need to be there!

Not everyone adapts; if your team wants to evolve, if everyone wants to improve, then everyone must find ways to improve.

If not, they won't get there!

In conclusion, Luiz summed up with a statement of concepts that I believe strongly in: either you pay now or you'll pay later!

This incentive format where the company supports the creation and growth of this culture of learning is not only ideal but also the most favorable for professional and company growth.

Investing in this is increasing technical quality and refining mutual trust and respect.

Kudos to Luiz and André... for another company that encourages good practices and the willingness to grow in our market. <a title="Apresentação" href="http://www.slideshare.net/bluesoftbr/construindo-uma-cultura-de-aprendizagem-5880225" target="_blank">Construindo uma cultura de aprendizagem </a>
