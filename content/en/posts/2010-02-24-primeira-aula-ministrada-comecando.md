There is a time that I commented on the invitation made by Potiguar University for me to teach the software engineering discipline, and today was the first class, following mainly what I expected as a student and guided by the coordination's guidelines, I elaborated the lesson plan that would provide students with general but practical knowledge of software development with solid objectives and focused on quality.

Below is the first class, anyone with some tips or suggestions, please feel free to join. I really wanted to learn these subjects in my graduation before even writing my first lines of code, this team can get close to this, I hope to help them write better codes.
