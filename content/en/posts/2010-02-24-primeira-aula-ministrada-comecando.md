There was a time when I commented on <a title="UnP" href="http://www.helmed.net/blog/2010/01/26/ola-unp-mais-um-professor-na-familia/" target="_self">convite realizado pela Universidade Potiguar</a> so that I could teach the software engineering discipline, and today was the first class, following mainly what I expected as a student and guided by the coordination's guidelines, I developed the course schedule that would provide students with general knowledge, but practical knowledge of software development with solid objectives and focused on quality.

Below is the first lesson, welcome anyone who has some tips or suggestions.

I really wanted to learn these subjects during my undergraduate studies, before even writing my first lines of code, this class may get close to it, I hope to help them write better codes. [slideshare id=3261384&doc=unp-aula1-100223193724-phpapp01]
