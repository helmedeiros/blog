subtitle: Learn how Riot Games scales League of Legends to 30 million active usersâ€”managing extreme technical complexity while maintaining engineering culture and team cohesion at massive scale
---

The keynote at [Jarrod Overson][1] started at 10:58h with a bit about his background

- he couldn't work on something different as a gamer.

With 15 years "remunerated" (as he says), he reached the point where his company has a huge product today, like [League of Legends][2], where online players get destroyed while the platform becomes ENORME!! <figure id="attachment_825" style="width: 468px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"> [<img class="size-full wp-image-825" alt="League of legends" src="/uploads/2014/04/League-of-legends-3.jpg" width="468" height="240" srcset="/uploads/2014/04/League-of-legends-3.jpg 468w, /uploads/2014/04/League-of-legends-3-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" />][3]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">League of legends</figcaption></figure> Imagine now his code, or the code written by Jarrod or his team to handle so many accesses.

Now think about how the company grows to follow the success and scale the needs of a new market that opens up.

For Jarrod, one of the most complicated parts is scaling people, hiring the right people who have the same principles and complementary desires

- it's complicated... very complicated.

And after growing, you lose everything good that you achieved when your company was small.

Companies, teams, people are inserted into different ecosystems that involve policies for access or freedom of expression.

How can this work?

The internet is a giant network composed of all this variety of views and effects and causes, and the community makes it with all their effort a scalable place.

It's asynchronous by necessity

- everything must be active, but how can you bring this to companies?

The internet is blind to class, race, and species, and finding value in this diversity is more than necessary to scale your company and product, because these experiences and the aggregated culture elevate debates and creations to a higher level. [RIOT Games][4] has done a bit of each of these things

- the change is for better because it doesn't cling to it.

Building a community, contribution, learning, cultural openness and equality. <figure id="attachment_827" style="width: 468px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"> [<img class="size-full wp-image-827" alt="Rioters are GAMERS" src="/uploads/2014/04/rioters.png" width="468" height="240" srcset="/uploads/2014/04/rioters.png 468w, /uploads/2014/04/rioters-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" />][5]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Rioters are GAMERS</figcaption></figure> The web has changed so much that just like companies, it needs more people and from all origins, paradigms, and languages.

The next big change to handle all the load on top of it will be supplied by all new APIs, frameworks, tags, and ideas and more ideas that are emerging, evolving, and surviving.

Companies, systems, and people should observe and learn from this model!

Some inventions are very cool and above all allow the ecosystem itself to transform and generate new inventions.

See the example of [ASM.js][6], a specification that allows transforming the web into a target for compilations.

Imagine the chaos when C programmers go to the web.

Compiled C code presented in the browser on demand, debugging C in the browser.

These types of creation and transformation don't bring scalability to a new level?

Each person with any level of knowledge can decide what the next decade will be!

The WEB in all its aspects is the biggest example of how we can achieve scalability.

We are the WEB and it belongs to future generations!

Contribute and get involved

- that's the final message from [Jarrod][7].
