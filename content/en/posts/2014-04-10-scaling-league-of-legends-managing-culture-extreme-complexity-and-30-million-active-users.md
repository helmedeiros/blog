The keynote by Jarrod Overson began at 10:58am with a little of his background, he as a gamer couldn't work on something different. With 15 years "remunerated" as he can say, he reached the point where his company has a big product today, League of Legends, in which online players deglaze themselves, while the platform becomes ENORME!!

League of legends
Imagine now your code or the code written by Jarrod or his team to handle so many accesses, and think about how the company grows to follow up on success and scale needs for a new market that opens.

For Jarrod, one of the most complicated parts is scaling people, hiring the right people who have the same principles and complementary desires... it's complicated...

And after you grow, you lose everything good that you got when you were a small company. Companies, teams, people are inserted in different ecosystems, which involve even access or freedom of expression policies. How can this work out?

The internet is a giant network composed of all this variety of views and effects and causes, and the community makes it with all its effort a good place to scale. It's asynchronous by necessity, everything must be active, but how to bring this to companies?

The internet is blind to class, race, and species, and finding value in diversity is more than necessary to scale your company and product, because experiences and aggregated culture elevate debates and creations to another level.

Riot Games has done a little of each of these things, the change is for better because it doesn't hug it. Building a community, contribution and learning, openness and equality culture.

Rioters are GAMERS
The web has changed so much that, just like companies, it needs more people and from all origins, paradigms, and languages.

The next big change to support the load on the same must be supplied by all new APIs, frameworks, tags, and ideas and more ideas that are emerging, evolving, and surviving.

Companies, systems, and people should observe and learn from this model!

Some inventions are very cool and above all allow the ecosystem itself to transform and generate new inventions.

See the example of ASM.js, a specification that allows transforming the web into a target for compilations. Imagine the mess when C programmers go to the web. Compiled C code presented in browser on demand. Debugging C in browser.

These types of creation and transformation don't take scalability to a new level? Each person with any level of knowledge can decide the next decade!

The WEB in all its aspects is the greatest example of how we can achieve scalability. We are the WEB, and it belongs to the next generations! Contribute and get involved - this is Jarrod's final message.
