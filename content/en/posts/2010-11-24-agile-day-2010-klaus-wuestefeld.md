The Agile Day 2010 in POA started officially at 09:00h, with Daniel Wildt presenting the idea of the event and its format with his enthusiastic agile attitude! For this year, there were 114 registered participants and only one missing presenter, André Nascimento wasn't there. Immediately after that, Klaus was introduced and started one of the planned keynotes for the day.

The presentation began at 09:20h with Klaus asking which of the congress participants actually worked on software development, and among those who had already put their software into production! He said he respected these guys.

Next, Klaus started presenting a bit of his history, from coding with friends as a teenager to escaping formal methods after attending the XP event in Italy in 2000 and creating a Byecycle fractal plugin with Kent Beck in a week, up until today and the Agile Day dilemma to be addressed in this presentation... How much should we prioritize quality in a project when its PO is urgent? Because if we have two variables and theoretically we can only increase one, reducing the other...

Without delay, Klaus threw a question to the congress participants: which of us could discern the quality of our own code or others' on a daily basis and which of us prioritized one of the two factors that are the focus of this discussion?... Few prioritize quality, many prioritize deadlines, and some try to strike a balance between both!

Next, inspired by the responses and referencing the fractal nature of codes, Klaus started working through examples to show the unconscious similarity in qualitative evaluations! We made some changes and coincidentally arrived at a simpler, more collectively reflective method that is higher quality. Then we did a second refactoring, which was immediately verified as unnecessary for some of us, but Klaus guided us calmly through the refactoring until this elimination.

Within this method existed a comment that was slightly inappropriate //METRO DE SAO PAULO, which was only removed after five baby steps with laughter. So Klaus reported on the cleanliness levels of São Paulo's metro based on the daily number of passengers transported and showed us an unconscious method for maintaining code cleanliness!

Next, we discussed how many of the dirtiness in code is linked to the difficulty of seeing, daily and simply, the code and its dependencies; a failure is easier to see when everything is simpler!

Finally, we should be concerned with standards and good technical practices instead of bickering over dilemmas like quality vs. deadline, for sure quality always so that deadlines are always more realistic and productivity is greater.

Klaus ended his presentation with a quote from GO, "throw away your first 100 games as quickly as possible".
