Agile Day 2010
The Agile Day 2010 POA started officially at 09:00h, with Daniel Wildt presenting the idea of the event and its format with that agile enthusiasm we always see in him! For this year, there were 114 registered attendees and one absent speaker, André Nascimento wasn't. Immediately after, Klaus was introduced and began one of the planned keynotes for the day.
The presentation started at 09:20h, with Klaus asking which congress attendees actually worked on software development and which had already put software into production! He said these were the guys he respected.

Right after, Klaus began presenting a bit of his history, from his friends' house with the pinball machine code, escaping formal methods after attending the XP event in Italy in 2000 and passing by the Byecycle – fractal plugin made with Kent Beck in a week until today and the Agile Day and the dilemma to be addressed in this presentation... How and up to what point can we ponder the quality of a project upon the urgent request of its PO. since we have two variables and theoretically, we can only increase one, reducing the other...
No delay, Klaus shot a question at the attendees: which ones had or could discern the quality of their codes or others' in daily life and which prioritized one of the two factors discussed more than the other... Few prioritize quality, many the deadline, and a little less in good balance between both!
Right after, driven by responses and referencing the fractal nature of codes, Klaus started working on examples to show the unconscious similarity in qualitative evaluations! We made some changes and coincidentally arrived at a simpler and collectively reflective method like higher quality. Then we did a second refactoring, which was immediately verified as unnecessary for some of us, but calmly Klaus guided us through baby steps throughout the refactoring until this elimination.
Within this method existed a comment slightly inappropriate //METRO DE SAO PAULO, which was only removed in one of the 5 baby steps over laughs. Then Klaus reported on the cleanliness levels of São Paulo's metro by the daily passenger transport and showed us an unconscious method for maintaining code cleanliness! A clean code with 4 lines, just like the metro, subconsciously induces citizens to think twice about where they will dirty up with two additional non-thought-out or elaborated lines.
Then we had questions on how clear our codes are, from 0 to 100%, in which, according to Klaus, 0% are codes written by 1,000 monkeys and 100% as something impeccable, where nothing needs to be changed.
Klaus finished his presentation with a GO quote, "lose your first hundred matches as quickly as possible".
