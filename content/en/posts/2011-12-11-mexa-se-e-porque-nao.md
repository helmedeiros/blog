 A recent participation in <a title="DESCONF 2011-Mustache edition" href="http://www.helmed.net/blog/2011/11/29/desconf-2011-mustache-edition/">Desconf 2011</a>, as well as conversations and events that aren't so recent, made me reflect on our behavior as agents of change in our work environment.

Many times we've heard or started debates with the phrase "this would never work where I work", happens... but you'll never be sure until you try.

 About a year ago, I tweeted happily that I was leaving for Christmas to tackle new tasks, meet new people, immerse myself in new domains, and face changes head-on.

What didn't seem strange at the time, despite being warned by GLeydson Lima, but which now makes perfect sense is my position on all of this.

I believe that everyone has already gone through or will go through a situation like this, where they put themselves in a smaller role with only one perspective: it's going to absolve much more if you just stay passive in learning.

However, things aren't always as we imagine them, and being surprised while learning or helping has been excellent.

This year I had the pleasure of participating in various events and listening to many good and intelligent people, [@dwildt][1], [@brunopedroso][2], [@alegomes][3], [@rwilli][4], __MD_Ref_6__, [@joaostein][6], [@julioprotzek][7], [@miprotzek][8], [@fkenjikamei][9], [@lcparzianello][10], [@manoelp][11], [@rafb3][12], [@hugocorbucci][13], [@dtsato][14], __MD_Ref_16__, [@paulocaroli][16], [@rafajagua][17] and [@thiagoesser][18], all of whom shared only a willingness to learn.

I participated in my first big event, [Agile Brazil 2011][19], and also the most innovative [desconf 2011][20], took part in the early steps of a new group, and between errors and successes learned a lot!!

In these last two weeks, I've been moving quickly to get back to helping with Stefanini OpenTalks, doing my best to continue changing.

We need to think about change and how we can make ourselves do what we expect others to do.

Along the way, I see that any team is capable and should strive to establish relationships not only professionally but also of friendship and commitment to the intellectual growth of their colleagues, a mutual growth.

I've worked in a great team, and each day that passes takes us another step in the direction I was looking for when I got here, but I'm still surprised at how much better it can be to be an active part of the transformation.

Last week, I shared this idea with new members of Stefanini, and I hope 2012 will bring more personality, open talks, study groups, and a lot of learning.

As Rafael Bandeira said... there's a lot of offline experience waiting for us!!
