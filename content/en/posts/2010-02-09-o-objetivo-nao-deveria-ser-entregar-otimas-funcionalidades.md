One thing that keeps intriguing me more and more each time I hear someone talking about using agile methodologies, and their clients remaining dissatisfied, even with software deliveries functioning, is whether we shouldn't anticipate the return on investment for our client by giving them subsidies to optimize the operation of their business?

Recently, I saw a tweet from <a title="Jeff Patton" href="http://twitter.com/jeffpatton" target="_blank">@jeffpatton</a>, "Looking forward to the time when people use agile development to build great products, not just deliver dumb stuff faster." And I see how it's constant reality in using agile methodologies, as was said by Akita in <a title="Você não entende nada de Scrum" href="http://akitaonrails.com/2009/12/10/off-topic-voce-nao-entende-nada-de-scrum" target="_blank">Você não entende nada de Scrum</a>. There is a need for adaptation in software development reality, but most interested parties are satisfied only with titles without the integral application of all necessary activities to make their process truly deserving of the title "agile." Kent Beck makes this clear in <a title="Extreme Programming Explained" href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416" target="_blank">eXtreme Programming explained</a>, "'XP is a discipline of software development. It's a discipline because there are certain things you need to do to be doing XP. You can't choose whether or not to write tests – if you don't, you're not doing XP and that's it.'"

How can we help a client improve their process when we don't know what we're trying to implement? The Agile Manifesto brings to its core the necessity and will of change; growth with adaptability. We should only be paying attention to what we're adapting to avoid masking the real problems that the methodology is trying to correct. We must deliver software as quickly as possible that functions with value for our clients, and for this, it's essential to know the letters we're putting in our process and respect them, whether these letters are practical, tools, processes, or methodologies.
