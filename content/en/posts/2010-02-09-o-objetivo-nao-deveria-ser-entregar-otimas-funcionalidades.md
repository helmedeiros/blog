One thing that intrigues me more and more each time I hear someone talking about agile methods and their clients remaining dissatisfied, even with software deliveries functioning as expected, is whether we shouldn't anticipate our client's return on investment by providing them with subsidies to optimize their business operations?

Recently, a tweet from @jeffpatton read, “Looking forward to the time when people use agile development to build great products, not just deliver dumb stuff faster.” And I see how it reflects reality in using agile methods, as mentioned by Akita in “You Don't Understand Scrum,” there is a need for adaptation in software development reality. However, most interested parties are satisfied only with the titles without applying all necessary activities to make their process truly worthy of the label "agile." Kent Beck makes this clear in "eXtreme Programming explained," “XP is a discipline of software development. It's a discipline because there are certain things you need to do to be doing XP. You won't be able to choose whether or not to write tests – if you don't, you're not doing XP and that's it.”

How can we help a client improve their process when we don't know what we're trying to implement? The agile manifesto brings forth the necessity and willingness for change; growth with adaptability. We should only be aware of what we're adapting to avoid masking the real problems that the methodology is trying to correct. We must deliver software as quickly as possible that functions with value for our clients, and to do so, it's essential to know the letters we're putting in our process and respect them, whether they are practical, tools, processes, or methodologies.
