It happened on this Thursday, January 13th, at the Auditório Assespro building 96 of <a title="TECNOPUC" href="http://www.pucrs.br/agt/tecnopuc/" target="_blank">Tecnopuc</a>, the first meeting of the <a title="Stefanini" href="http://www.stefanini.com.br/BR/home.html" target="_blank">Stefanini </a> Open Talks.

This new initiative proposed by collaborator <a title="Marcelo Schmidt" href="http://twitter.com/schmidtmarcelo" target="_blank">Marcelo Schmidt</a> together with the administrative team responsible for customer account <a title="DELL" href="http://www.dell.com.br/" target="_blank">DELL</a> aims to involve institution colleagues around various topics.

Having its origin in <a title="Brown Bags seminar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bag_seminars" target="_blank">brown bags seminars</a>, the event follows a format with 15-minute presentations and other 15 minutes for questions.

At this first meeting, I presented <a title="Pomodoro Technique" href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">técnica pomodoro</a>, created by <a title="Francesco Cirillo" href="http://twitter.com/cirillof" target="_blank">Francesco Cirillo,</a> about how I used it in refactoring one of DELL's systems, and what benefits were found in using this technique and its impact on the final work result.

The Pomodoro is a technique with few rules and great effect for time management, based on very short cycles (30 minutes), where execution, reflection, adaptation, and rest take place.

This format allows users to do more focused work, with even greater opportunities for developing strategies and actions aimed at continuous personal and process improvement.

During these 30 minutes, we have two <a title="timeboxing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing" target="_blank">timeboxes</a>, one with 25 minutes for executing the planned activity and the remaining 5 minutes for adaptation/rest; these cycles occur four times, and then there is a slightly longer interval of 15 to 30 minutes.

During this entire cycle, a small set of rules governs the orchestra, making it possible for the technique to assist its user in visualizing problems in their use, such as different types of interruptions (internal and external) and planning issues.

To use Pomodoro, only two spaces are needed: one for noting activities that arise or are estimated or de-prioritized, and another for separating what will be done on the day.

After estimating and balancing the list for the day, simply define the timebox and work as best you can within what was planned.

As the day goes by and planned activities are concluded, new problems always emerge that need to be managed (noted, analyzed, and resolved).

The important thing is not to forget these issues, and it's interesting, something I usually add to the technique's scope when applying, are the **rules of depth** and the **knowledge of dirt**.

The rule of depth, I don't know if there's anything actually with this name (please let me know if anyone has a name for this), which came to me as a concept in the book by <a title="Kent Beck" href="http://twitter.com/kentbeck" target="_blank">Kent Beck</a> <a title="TDD:

By Example" href="http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530" target="_blank">Test Driven development:

By example</a>, that defines that a certain error found must have a limit for profundation, since a code problem can bring many levels of refactoring that would directly interfere with the planned.

The rule of dirt refers to statistically knowing how dirty your environment was (in my case, during refactoring), and how much better it's becoming; I usually use as a factor in this analysis the number of interruptions or possible interruptions I see during a refactoring, relative to my own code (These are marked on my TODO list with a +); the fewer + I see over the days of a refactoring, the more I believe in possible improvement in the code.

I saw significant improvements in quality and efficiency in my work using this technique, so I found it interesting to present it to the other team members.

Thank you to Stefanini for the space and the team for participating; and I hope that future Stefanini Open Talks will be even better. <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
