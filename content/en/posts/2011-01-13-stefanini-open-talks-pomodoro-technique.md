subtitle: Experiences and learnings from technology events

Today, Thursday January 13th, I had the opportunity to kick off the very first edition of Stefanini Open Talks, held at the Assespro Auditorium in building 96 of Tecnopuc. This initiative came out of conversations with Marcelo Schmidt and the administrative team of Stefanini responsible for the Dell account. Our goal was both simple and ambitious: to create a shared learning space inside our operation, celebrating the knowledge we build through our daily experiences.

The inspiration came from formats like brown bags and lightning talks, where the content is sharp and timeboxed — 15 minutes of talk, 15 of Q&A. Today, that time extended a bit, and I realized this space has much more potential than we initially imagined.

My presentation focused on the **Pomodoro Technique**, originally created by Francesco Cirillo. But I didn't want to just repeat formal definitions — my goal was to show how I've actively used Pomodoro in a real Dell project during a critical refactor. I wanted to present a _living practice_ — used, tested, and reflected upon.

Pomodoro relies on short time blocks, typically 30 minutes divided into 25 of focused execution and 5 of rest or reorganization. It seems simple, and that's where its power lies: minimal structure that reduces friction and maximizes attention. I started small and quickly saw gains in both productivity and clarity.

During cycles, I jot down everything that comes up — interruptions, side ideas, future blockers. This collection turns into input for later decisions. It's a way to shield my active work time and keep my mind clear.

One aspect I brought to the talk — and which sparked some discussion — was **my personal adaptation of the technique**, where I write down the exact goal of each cycle before starting. Something like "finish contract endpoint payload transformation." That small ritual changes everything.

I also shared thoughts on internal and external interruptions. Real-life examples helped: chatty office neighbors, browser alerts, the temptation to check that fresh PR. I listed some tactics I use, like muting Slack channels or using visual signs to set boundaries.

The audience was especially receptive to my concept of **depth as a success metric**. I presented what I call the "depth rule," inspired by readings like Kent Beck's _Test Driven Development: By Example_. When a technical task uncovers layers that weren't originally planned, we must decide whether to deepen or park them.

I also talked about what I call **knowledge of dirt** — a rule of thumb I developed by observing repeated issues across the same modules and flows. Mapping this "dirty ground" helps us anticipate complexity and focus our refactoring efforts based on statistical recurrence.

I made sure to show how I apply Pomodoro beyond code: reviewing documentation, prepping slides, organizing support tasks. The technique isn't just for developers — it's for _any_ task that demands focused delivery.

I explained how I use **visual lists**, separating today's priorities from deprioritized items. Moving a post-it from one column to another gives me a sense of control and keeps infinite to-do lists at bay.

Midway through, someone asked how to scale this to teams. My answer was straightforward: it starts solo, but the collective effect is powerful. When three or four people around you respect their focus blocks, a micro-culture of productivity emerges.

I even showed examples of teams running synchronized Pomodoros — starting and ending blocks together. That cuts cross-interruptions and enforces discipline during daily rituals.

To visualize it, I presented a chart mapping cycles, interruptions, and weekly delivery metrics. It helped show how small daily wins compound into measurable impact.

I also discussed **how to assess whether a Pomodoro was successful**. It doesn't always yield a commit. Sometimes the win is deferring a bad idea, uncovering a deep bug, or making a future plan. Results aren't just about finishing — they're about making better decisions.

I closed by sharing complementary practices: quick cycle reviews, end-of-day journaling, and personal weekly retros. Simple tools that build consistency without relying on memory or motivation.

I shared how Pomodoro helped me through tough times — like balancing work and family emergencies. Having a lightweight structure gave me confidence to show up, even on emotionally heavy days.

I wrapped up with something I truly believe: productivity isn't about going faster. It's about aligning intention, attention, and action. For me, Pomodoro has become a bridge between energy and delivery.

Huge thanks to Stefanini for the space, to Marcelo Schmidt for coordinating the event, and to all my Dell colleagues for the generous knowledge exchange. I hope we have more sessions like this — where practice meets the courage to share.

If you've never tried Pomodoro, run one tomorrow. And if you have, try adding a personal metric for depth. I promise it's worth it.
