It happened on this Thursday, January 13th, at the Auditório da Assespro building 96 of Tecnopuc, the first meeting of Stefanini Open Talks.
This new initiative proposed by collaborator Marcelo Schmidt along with the administrative team responsible for the DELL account, aims to involve institution colleagues around various themes. Having originated from brown bag seminars, the event follows the division of lightning talks with 15 minutes of presentation and other 15 minutes for questions.

In this first meeting, I presented the Pomodoro technique created by Francesco Cirillo, explaining how I used it in the refactoring of one of DELL's systems, and what benefits were found in using this technique and its impact on the final work result.
Pomodoro is a technique with few rules and much effect for time management, based on very short cycles (30 minutes), where execution, reflection, adaptation, and rest take place. This format allows its users to work even more focused, with greater chances of elaborating strategies and actions aiming at continuous personal and process improvement.

During these 30 minutes, we have two timeboxes: one with 25 minutes for the planned activity and the remaining 5 minutes for adaptation/rest; these cycles occur four times and then there is a slightly longer interval of 15 to 30 minutes. Throughout this cycle, a small set of rules governs the orchestra, making it easier for the technique to help its user visualize problems in their use, such as different types of interruptions (internal and external) and planning problems.

To use Pomodoro, only one space is needed for notes on activities that arise or are estimated/deferred, and another for separating what will be done that day. After estimating and balancing the list for the day, just define the timebox and work as well as possible within what was planned.

During the course of the day and the conclusion of the planned activities, new problems always emerge that need to be managed (noted, analyzed, and resolved), the important thing is that they are not forgotten, and for this it is interesting, and something I usually add to the technique's scope when applying, are the rules of depth and knowledge of dirt. The rule of depth, I don't know if there is really a name for this (please let me know if someone has a name for this), which came to me as a concept in Kent Beck's book Test Driven development: By example, which defines that a certain error found should have a limit for depth, since a code problem can bring many levels of refactoring that would directly interfere with the planned work. Already the rule of dirt refers to knowing statistically how dirty your environment was (in my application case in refactoring environments), and how much better it is becoming, I usually use as a factor for this analysis the number of interruptions or possible interruptions that I see during a refactoring, which are marked on my TODO list with a +; the fewer + I see over the course of the days of a refactoring, the more I believe in a possible improvement in the code.

I saw a significant improvement in quality and efficiency in my work using this technique, so I thought it was interesting to present it to other team members. Thank you to Stefanini for the space and the team for participation; and I hope that future Stefanini Open Talks will be even better.
