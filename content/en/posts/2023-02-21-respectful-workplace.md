## Beyond Equality: Building a Respectful and Equitable Workplace

Creating a respectful workplace is not about checking boxes. It's about doing the deep work of understanding systems, histories, and lived experiences — and committing, as leaders and teammates, to equity over comfort.

The Respectful Workplace training at Omio reminded us that respect is not neutral. It requires curiosity, humility, and intention. It's about moving beyond the passive "treat everyone the same" into the active "do what it takes to support people where they are." That difference is the core of equity.

One of the first themes explored was **intersectionality** — the way race, gender, class, sexuality, ability, and other identities overlap to shape how someone experiences the world. As leaders, we are responsible for learning how these intersecting identities influence people's sense of safety, opportunity, and belonging at work.

Equity means recognizing that not everyone starts at the same line. Policies that seem "fair" on the surface may disproportionately affect those with less access, less privilege, or fewer safety nets. Leading with empathy means learning what we don't know — and choosing to listen, not assume.

The workshop also touched on the impact of **cultural differences** — not in a surface-level way, but by asking how values like time, hierarchy, expressiveness, and personal space show up across global teams. Culture isn't just about where someone is from. It's about what they've had to normalize to succeed.

This session helped me reflect on times when I've misunderstood a colleague, not because of conflict but because of **difference**. Respectful workplaces aren't about avoiding discomfort — they're about leaning into it with openness, asking better questions, and creating space for others to show up fully.

Language was another major theme. The power of words, tone, and framing cannot be overstated. Using inclusive language isn't about political correctness — it's about safety. Words either open doors or reinforce walls. Leaders must be intentional in how we refer to identity, race, gender, ability, and background.

Microaggressions were also covered in depth. These aren't always malicious — but they're always harmful. Repeated small actions like talking over someone, mispronouncing names, making assumptions about family, or excluding someone from an after-work event can pile up. What might feel "small" is cumulative. A respectful workplace doesn't ignore microaggressions — it notices and responds with accountability.

The most impactful moment for me was this: **Respect is not something we declare — it's something others feel.** That means we don't get to decide alone if a space is safe. We must ask. We must listen. And when someone tells us something didn't land well, we must receive that feedback with humility, not defensiveness.

Equity work is not reactive. It's not a fix for a bad situation. It's a leadership strategy for building culture. It requires asking who is being centered, who is being silenced, and who is being stretched beyond their share to make things work.
