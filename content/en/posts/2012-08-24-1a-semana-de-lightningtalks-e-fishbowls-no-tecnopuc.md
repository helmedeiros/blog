It happened a few hours ago, the 4th day of the 1st Week of LightningTalks and FishBowls at TecnoPUC where I presented Test Driven Development – In Search of Useful and Concrete Feedback, which addressed the concept of validated feedback in software construction.
Many teams and communities I've passed through have been talking a lot about tests and QA, but apparently many of them are still running and struggling with the same battles every day. When I say the same, I'm not referring to high-level issues like lack of specification or completely neglecting user opinion, but rather bugs in software, such as company X's product Y has already released 3 versions this year with the "send" button completely invisible to the client. How can we still make these types of errors? Remember that old saying: do something wrong once, okay! But commit the same error again...
Many companies have been stuck in their initial strategy of testing scenarios where the same things work as endless checklists of actions that need to be repeated every time a new version is released, and each error found is apparently being added to this document. Good for a first step, but light-years away from starting to scratch the surface of efficiency. Here it's not about how long we'll remember to execute; failure will happen and be evident in just one moment you forget.
Plans are great starting points, but you must be ready to evolve them at any cost.

> Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face – Mike Tyson

It's very difficult to follow a script with perfection when there's so much at stake or minimal error. At this point, stress and test execution enter what was defined as direct influence relationships, so the more stress, the less attention and quality in performing tests, and thus uncertainty about test quality generates even more stress over what might happen (Gerald Weinberg's influence graph). At this point, stress can be even more destructive. Imagine how many times a hotfix has blown away all prioritization lists and, after 30 minutes of frantic development, went straight to production because there was no time for testing – another error appeared!

Test-Driven Development or TDD is a software development technique created/presented by Kent Beck that guides our work based on conscious choices and minimally viable options, encouraging confidence in what we're delivering. TDD works in the order and mode we deliver new functionalities, automating our acceptance criteria or internal system features with small, safe steps that allow us to execute these plans quickly, just like application growth, so we know when everything is right or not!! Values like COURAGE and FEEDBACK from Extreme Programming are reinforced – the more you walk with constant feedback about the effect of your changes on the rest of the code, the braver you'll be to adopt changes and truly evolve your application.
