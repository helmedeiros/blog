Below is the second lesson given in the software engineering discipline at UnP, who have some tips or suggestions are still very welcome.

We had a brief passage through the history of software creation today, we talked about the "software crisis" that, despite being dated back a long time ago, still does not show evidence of correction of all the factors that influenced it.

The components of a software project were presented and we discussed some scenarios and what influence each of these has on the final result, success or failure in the project.

We saw software engineering concepts and their need to guide through techniques for software with quality, repeatable deliveries that meet needs but cost little or are interesting comparing cost and ROI. [slideshare id=3321154&doc=unp-aula2-100302190530-phpapp02]
