<div style="text-align: left">
 I recently received an intriguing message from a software engineering student at another university:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div>
 “It was mentioned in my software engineering class about an element that I didn't understand well, something cited in some engineering books, called the 'Masked Man' or 'Man of the Mask', and I would like to know what role it plays in software engineering and where I can find more information about this”.
</div>

</blockquote>

<p>

<div style="text-align: left">
 When I read this message, I immediately thought it was some student or friend trying to make a joke.

I had no knowledge to respond, and with so many <a title="Buzzword" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword" target="_blank">buzzwords</a> in our profession, I discarded any possibility of the questions being true about the role or practice involving a 'Masked Man' or 'Man of the Mask', within the scope of software engineering.

 The term "Masked Man" used by artist B.

C.

Boyer in the 80s for a masked character fighting crime was used again a decade later in <a title="Tool Support for Project Tracking" href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/ieeesoftware/bp11.htm" target="_blank">Tool Support for Project Tracking </a>'s column "Best Practices" in IEEE Software, written monthly by <a title="Steve McConnell" href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/" target="_blank">Steve McConnell</a>, author of book <a title="Code Complete" href="http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Microsoft-Programming-Steve-McConnell/dp/1556154844" target="_blank">Code Complete</a>.

 According to Steve, it is essential to track our project plans and schedules in real-time.

If you don't do activities like this as a member of an auto-managed team or project manager, you will probably fail.

Within this context, <a title="Tool Support for Project Tracking" href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/ieeesoftware/bp11.htm" target="_blank">Tool Support for Project Tracking </a> presents some good practices, such as the "Masked Man" or "Man of the Mask", which presents an impartial and anonymous way for reporting bad news within projects.

Unlike messengers of good news, those carrying bad news may be penalized in some way, so it is recommended to use electronic bulletin boards with anonymous posting visible throughout the company's hierarchy, where any employee can highlight individual or collective problems.

</div>

<blockquote>

<div>
 “If developers are turning their code over to testing later than scheduled, a concerned tester can report that.

If testers are releasing builds to documentation that have not been well tested, a concerned technical writer can report that.

If a project manager is exaggerating the project's progress in reports to upper management, a concerned developer can report that.”

</div>

<div style="text-align: left">
 Current methodologies, mainly agile ones, define good communication as crucial to project success.

The Agile Manifesto defines individuals and interactions over processes and tools, which is what I see failing with the Masked Man concept, bureaucratization and impersonality of feedback, which functions like a command-control system, generating more discomfort among team members than improvements.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left">
 According to <a title="Kent Beck" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck" target="_blank">Kent Beck</a>, in their book <a title="XP Explained" href="http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416" target="_blank">Extreme Programming Explained</a>, when we analyze the problems that occur in projects, we see that many of them were caused by someone who didn't talk to someone else about something important.

This poor communication doesn't happen by chance, and it is at this point that practices like Steve McConnell's tend to distance members and delay feedback, a programmer should not be punished by their manager or colleague for presenting bad news.

 Corrections on the project path must always be made and receive as much information as possible honestly, freely, and in advance.

Then, before we make our workplaces even more complicated with anti-productive practices, we should strive to cultivate and encourage practices that strengthen commitment and impartiality in our teams and projects.

Before our team starts polishing their resumes, we should encourage practices like those reinforced by <a title="Esther" href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/profiles/10" target="_blank">Esther Derby</a> and <a title="Diana" href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/profiles/8019-diana-larsen" target="_blank">Diana Larsen</a>, in <a title="Agile Retrospective" href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/dlret/agile-retrospectives" target="_blank">Agile Retrospectives</a>, strategies are found daily and can be reinforced cycle after cycle, adapting personal decisions or course corrections in an impersonal way.

Above all, we are teams.
