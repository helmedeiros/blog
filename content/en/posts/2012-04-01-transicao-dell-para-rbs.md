_This is Part 7 of 7 in the [Life in Porto Alegre](/en/series/life-in-porto-alegre/) series._

Today marks the end of an incredibly meaningful chapter in my career.

My time at **Dell, through Stefanini**, was short in calendar months — but **intense, rich, and formative**. I leave with deep gratitude for everything I've learned and everyone I've worked with. This wasn't just a job. It was an environment where **empathy met high performance**, and where every line of code, every review, and every ceremony felt anchored in purpose.

On my last day, I was still pushing code, reviewing pull requests, and leaving handovers. **It felt good to end the way we worked: focused, accountable, and proud.**

### Thank You

To **Eduardo Mathias**, for modeling what it means to lead through **autonomy, mastery, and trust**.

To **Carlos Eduardo "Cadu" Maciel**, for being a constant source of technical depth and coaching that helped me grow daily.

To **Ulisses**, for your sharpness and your generosity in teaching and guiding.

To **Dell and Stefanini**, for placing me in a team that made me better — and made me want to be better for others.

This crew taught me what it means to ship quality **without losing care for each other**. That's rare. I'll take it with me.

### What's Next

Next week I start a new role with **RBS Group**, one of the largest media companies in the south of Brazil. They've launched a **new digital division** focused on exploring the **future of news** — and it looks like an incredible place to keep learning and building.

I'm excited. Nervous. Motivated. And most of all, grateful.

To my teammates and friends at Dell: thank you for the intensity, the laughs, the code, and the care. It's been an honor.

See you all around — in code, in conferences, in the next adventure.
