On October 22 and 23, Universidade Potiguar – RN will host its **11th Scientific Congress**, and this year I have the honor of returning — this time as a speaker.

I was invited by the Information Systems department to teach an **eight-hour mini-course on SCRUM**, focused on how to turn groups into teams that **deliver continuous customer value**.

## A Journey That Began as a Student

I attended this congress as a student in previous years. I remember with fondness the talks by Prof. Paulo Benício on OpenGL programming — the kind of content that inspired me and planted the seeds of the curiosity I continue to follow today.

Coming back to UnP now as an invited speaker is truly moving. It's a deep feeling of gratitude — not just for the chance to share what I've learned, but for reconnecting with a space that always valued open knowledge and peer learning.

## To Learn is to Be Curious, to Participate is to Be Generous

Being a student isn't just attending class — it's about **showing up, asking questions, connecting with others**. Events like this scientific congress are an invitation to dive deeper. To learn through exchange, through hallway chats, through that shy question at the end of a session.

I'm grateful to all those who once prepared a talk, shared a slide, or explained a real-world example to beginners. Now it's a great pleasure to **pay it forward** and share my own stories with those on the same path.

## So What is SCRUM?

For those unfamiliar: **SCRUM is an agile framework for managing complex product development.** It organizes work into short cycles called **sprints**, enabling continuous delivery, frequent feedback, and a focus on real customer value.

## My Experience with SCRUM

My SCRUM journey began at **Unimed Brasil**, where I worked on IT projects that required flexibility, rhythm, and collaboration.

Later, I had the opportunity to apply and adapt SCRUM within **UnP** itself — both in the Information Technology department and in the Software Analysis & Development program. It's where I saw firsthand how agile practices could drive transparency, consistency, and continuous learning.

## See You There?

The [event schedule](https://unp.br) is packed with current topics and passionate speakers, all coming together to teach and learn. If you're in the tech world (or even if you're not), come by! I'd love to talk about teamwork, agility, and community with fellow curious minds.

See you soon! ✨
