In a recent post and during our conversations during breaks in the course, Phillip mentioned that this would probably be the last year of the course...

I'm very happy I was able to take advantage of the opportunity.

The course started at 09:20h due to some issues with the Apple mini display port -> projector with VGA input, Nico Steppat, who was there, quickly provided a notebook to replace Phillip's Mac Pro and the lecture began with the warning that the computer didn't belong to him and that certainly there would be problems... modesty aside, the course was very good.

Coming from Natal/RN, I was impressed by the number of .NET developers interested in DDD.

This type of course in my hometown would certainly be dominated by Railers and Java developers.

We had 17 students divided into 4 groups for a thorough accompaniment, with the instructor, on the creation of a domain model based on user stories presented for a parking lot.

The course was held over three modules, with the first two taking place in the morning, starting at 09:20h and ending at 13:00h.

In the first part, Phillip covered the necessary decisions to be taken when first encountering an application, which he divided into three questions:

What, How, and What For.

The second part talked about languages and how it's important to speak the same language during project development, avoiding the creation or proliferation of technical or semantic noise.

We all had lunch nearby, and as with any good geek gathering, we exchanged ideas and experiences... in those hours, there's no distance learning that's worth it!!!

We returned to Caelum at 14:00h, and with various practices, we learned some patterns and techniques that help us use a single language in our projects.

So here's the personal tip, tomorrow will be Phillip's last day of courses at Caelum.

He'll still be in Brazil for some time.

And judging by the vibes we shared today, I can say that the guy is really tough !!!

And it's far from being those snobbish stars we stumble upon around here!!!

Thanks, Phillip, and thanks to Caelum.
