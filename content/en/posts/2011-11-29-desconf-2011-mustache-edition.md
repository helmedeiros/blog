Hosted by [Faculdade Dom Bosco][2], the DESCONF 2011 mustache edition declared freedom of expression as its theme, with an unconventional format that mixed open spaces and [lightning talks][3], having a representation of 62% of its registered participants as speakers, but which in proportions of time inside and outside the auditorium everyone ended up defining and debating their lines of thought, and couldn't offer anything less than a day of great learning.

The event started at 09h with registration and an excellent coffee break.

Right at the entrance, it was clear that the organizing team's intention was to promote a relaxed atmosphere with [Rafael Bandeira][4] and Felipe Cabral at the table with mustache and beard respectively well characterized, as well as the [Natalia Arsand][5] that gave out fake mustaches to the youngsters!

Near 10h we had the first intervention organized by DESCONF, invited by Bandeira, where everyone went to the auditorium where the first activities were held to break the ice, with many applause for the organizers, sponsors, and cheers!

We defined the rules below and started the [lightning talks][3].

- We shouldn't leave the camera's field of view so that ideas could reach more than the 80 participants;

- Each presentation shouldn't exceed 5min;

- Everyone should applaud after these 5min;

- And whoever spoke the fastest would be next.

The starting gun was given in a quick and relaxed presentation of facts, history, and photos about the event's theme.

There was no doubt that having a beard is synonymous with freedom, my wife who doesn't listen to me... ðŸ™‚ [Apresentei][6] my vision on the possibility of success for projects beyond short learning cycles, as preached by [Eric Ries][7], with a follow-up of promising ideas and current restrictive factors over time through the book of possibilities.

There were many convergences of ideas and complementary topics, and each new speaker brought a new surprise.

They spoke about [mantras de possibilidades][8], sailor history and its real efficiencies, about [despertar o UAU][9] customers and how ideas converged more quickly in [ecologias criativas][10].

We had insights on [negociaÃ§Ã£o][11], [hackerspaces][12], startups and their [lados negros][13].

Design and [UX][14].

All themes and tastes!

After the whole day, there was nothing left to do but thank everyone who participated, for the ideas I heard and discussed.

The pizzas were great, and the atmosphere was really conducive to learning and idea evolution.

And from the idea that #desconf should go mainstream, I leave the question:

Do only the most experienced need to be heard, and the phrase of [Christian Heilmann][15] " [Where Known speakers come from][16]?".

THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO DESCONF!

Let's hope for the 2012 edition.
