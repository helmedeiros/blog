## A Year to Learn, Share, and Grow

I'm thrilled to begin this new chapter in my leadership journey by participating in Omio's management training program. Over the next few months, I'll be joining peers across the company to deepen our understanding of what it means to lead with purpose, communicate with clarity, and support our teams through real change.

This isn't about starting from scratch â€” it's about building on what's working and discovering new ways to grow. Since stepping into a managerial role, I've been constantly learning: through experience, through mistakes, and through every honest conversation with my team. These training sessions are a chance to validate some of what I've already been practicing, and to explore better approaches guided by experienced leaders and facilitators.

So far, the sessions have included themes like _Leading Change_, _Responsive Leadership_, _Respectful Workplace_, _Performance Management_, and of course, the foundational _First 90 Days_. Each one focuses on practical challenges â€” from setting clear expectations to handling feedback loops and navigating ambiguity as a team grows. They're not lectures. They're conversations. And that's what makes them stick.

One of the best parts of this journey has been learning alongside other managers who are just as invested in doing the right thing for their teams. We've shared stories, strategies, frustrations, and small wins â€” and through that, I'm already feeling more confident and connected in my role.

If you're starting your leadership path, I recommend you bookmark these materials and reflect on each session as we go. I'll keep sharing my experiences from each training here â€” what resonated, what I'll be applying, and where I still need to grow. Leadership isn't a solo sport. Let's keep learning together.
