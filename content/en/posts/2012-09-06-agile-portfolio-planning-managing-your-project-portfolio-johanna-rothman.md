Johanna started by thanking for the invitation and saying how happy she is to be in Brazil. And with a question like, do you guys love working on multi-tasking projects? Many may enjoy it but what to do first? And when there are interruptions? We can't spend all our time looking for our managers to tell us what to do. We need and want to use our brains and participate and decide for ourselves what to do.

What The Problem
For us, it might be complicated to handle this, but management is about multitasking and that's transparent to them, but development isn't like that; we need to concentrate, without interruptions or else the loops will never end! And multi-tasking layers in projects don't stop here; they rise to portfolio levels, where desires can mix with reality, where several projects start while we have the shortest month of the year with many festivals and ski seasons. For Johanna, it's very interesting that we have a division in our portfolio of what is expected and where we won't have a team to do it and an intermediate level that involves projects with your team can make all the difference.

What These Portfolios Are Missing
But what is a project portfolio? We can't just have a set of projects in a basket and think this is the portfolio, and even less can we group them and execute such a plan as if all could be run and built at the same time! We need to stop some of them and what cannot be done should not be attempted because we will change our feet for hands and disorganize your team. After defining priorities, start dates, and end dates, we pass to have a portfolio? But when can they be considered as concluded or acceptably concluded? We need to decide that's it, then we'll be closer to reality.

We need then with the portfolios created use them to our advantage, not changing frantically people inside it because thus they will lose their most important senses like "velocity" and projects may turn from predictable to chaotic; definitely we don't want that. We need to use them working with internal and strategic values of these in our product concepts, re-prioritizing projects and tasks until we reach perfect organization in terms of productivity, quality, and delivery of value.

Project Portfolio Flow
But what frequency should we deal with decisions in our portfolio? Once a year, every week? According to Johanna, we need to adapt with points like MMF.
Something that can help us and start thinking in terms of successive questioning, like do we have enough people to test, develop, do we have money for that? How do we expect the adoption curve of our clients to behave? And mainly how this project can promote our team to a higher level! Qualitative questions should be considered as well as quantitative ones but always the former as more important.

We need to understand various types of projects, prioritize and re-prioritize functional and product features, for Johanna there are three types of projects: those that keep the company running, those that will strengthen and grow our companies and those that will create excellent and great opportunities in our companies! Which one is which type in your portfolio?

So if we decide what project is more important we can help everyone understand our company, avoiding each one choosing their favorites and all feeling lost, with more progress and fewer imperfections.
And will Agile and Lean help? Maybe if we keep in mind that people are not machines and we need not only automation of everything but a prioritized humanization of thought!

It doesn't matter how many projects you start; it's how many you finish.
