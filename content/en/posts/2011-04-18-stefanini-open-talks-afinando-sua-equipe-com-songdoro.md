Continuing the tradition of [brown bags seminars][1] at Stefanini, I gave a presentation this week on a combination that has been asserting itself as the modern productive tripod; after my last presentation at Stefanini Open Talks, where I spoke about tips and shared some of my experience and results achieved with the application of [POMODORO][2], it's time to talk about a concept that Daniel Wildt was talking about at the last Agile Brazil, and more recently, I heard it mentioned several times in the movie "Rede Social" as the secret to increasing one's productive capacity.

A motivated person can move mountains, and staying motivated is something strangely common that happens many times for me when I hear the right words, the right rhythm!

SONGDORO comes to align the cancellation or transformation of ambient sound into something that motivates and enthuses us to achieving our goals.

I think we all have that music that keeps us attuned!

A pattern of notes that leaves our organism ready for some action.

These are power songs… songs or sequences of music that add to one's motivation, and discovering and aligning them is what has helped me in various moments to meet deadlines or leave me more energized!!

Just like the Pomodoro technique, the rule is to work in short cycles of concentration with space for reflection and adaptation, something around 30 minutes, being 25 minutes of task execution and 5 minutes of rest/reflection.

For me, the 25-minute music has worked very well.

The idea is to build playlists with this time frame that point you out, just like on your weekend run in the park, when it's time to walk... run or appreciate nature!!!

There are well-formulated instructions on Daniel's blog for those who want to delve deeper!! <http://danielwildt.wordpress.com/tag/songdoro/>
