Continuing the tradition of brown bag seminars at Stefanini, I gave a presentation this week in a series that aimed to assert how the modern productive tripod works; after the last presentation at Stefanini Open Talks, where I spoke about tips and shared some of my experience and results achieved with the application of POMODORO, it's now time to talk about a concept that Daniel Wildt mentioned during the last Agile Brazil, and more recently, I watched the movie "Rede Social" and heard various times how plugging in is the secret to increasing one's productive capacity at high levels.

A motivated person can move mountains, and staying motivated is something strangely common that happens many times with me when I hear the right words, the right rhythm! SONGDORO comes to ally the annullment or transformation of ambient sound into something that motivates and enthuses people to achieve their objectives.

I think everyone has that music that leaves us feeling antsy! A pattern of notes that gets our organism ready for some action. Those are power songs... songs or sequences of songs that add to one's motivation, and discovering and aligning them is what has helped me in various moments to meet deadlines or leave me more energized!!

Just like Pomodoro, the rule is to work in short concentration cycles with space for reflection and adaptation, around 30 minutes, being 25 minutes of task execution(s) and 5 minutes of rest/reflection. With me, the 25 music minutes have worked very well. The idea is to build playlists with this time, that point out as during your weekend park run when you should walk... run or appreciate nature!!

There are well-formatted instructions on Daniel's blog for those who want to delve deeper!!
