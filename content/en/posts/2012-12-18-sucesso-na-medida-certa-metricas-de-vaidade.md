Success in the right measure – Vanity Metrics
Recently, a development team presented to managers the defense of quality as an agent of growth. They were presenting a graph that showed that when they started focusing on quality, they obtained a growth in the number of registrations. Meanwhile, the marketing sector one day after this presentation complained about credits and presented ads as a factor in a 170% increase... Which was really the trigger for success?!? Maybe both?
Many times in our pursuit of possible or immediate success, we forget true goals. In the previous example, we had an increase in registrations, which is excellent on its own! However, nothing happened regarding signatures, which is the direct form of monetization. The reports and debates aimed at strategies to expand conversion rates, and everything that was justified and planned affected only the registrations.
When we seek success, we need metrics and strategies that support our decisions, presenting concrete facts about the gaps made on the basis of assumptions in our strategies. It seems good to be successful isn't being successful. The theater of success one day is discovered, and ideas are abandoned.
We cannot base ourselves solely on cumulative totals! Our users, registrations, sales, and other demands are always multifaceted, and no matter how complex it becomes, we must separate them, as each group can indicate the path to success and make all the difference.

A metric should help you reflect on your current situation and plan the next steps and choices. Don't deceive yourself. Remember that your metrics should help you see this. Or even more, discover what's not working and correct it along the way.
Taiichi Ohno defined, some time ago, within the Toyota model, Genchi Genbutsu, which advises us to get out and see for ourselves where problems occur. If something isn't going well, we need to go on site to discover which assertions and assumptions had unobserved variations.

We need to stop making guesses and scientifically quantify and divide groups. We need to know about which people our changes were effective, we need to work in cohorts instead of meaningless totals.
Instead of reports with vanity metrics, we need to work in terms of the three aisles. A actionable report will allow everyone to analyze in terms of cause and effect for obtaining the resulting indices, an accessible report will allow analysis so that everyone can understand and access it, and an auditable report will enable confidence in the data. Avoiding constant debates about "the real situation of projects".

Still, they might say we have all the necessary statistical data regarding what our client wants, we can take advantage of research done by MIT or another institution, we know how Facebook reached its current situation is just copy, repeat, or modify minimally! Maybe not?!? We cannot forget how influential your customers' culture can be. They may be very different from those in other places where the research was applied; their work culture may be completely different from their home culture! Where was the research done? What year? What is the relationship between the culture lived in the environment?

Let's go, everyone has great ideas at some point in life. Then why don't we create them? And who knows while we're doing that, we put the strategy on paper like a rough map, where we can stop and think at each intersection but never lose focus on the final goal. Always thinking, acting as if, and removing what's not aligned early on.
