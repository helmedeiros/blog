The last scenario among the proposed items follows a business rule.
Bruno and his father bought a plot of land and will open a parking lot.
To help, Bruno's sister is developing an application for parking control.
When a vehicle enters the parking lot, the attendant observes its plate and it is registered along with the vehicle model and color.
The entry time is generated automatically, corresponding to the moment of plate registration.
After parking the vehicle, the customer picks up a ticket where the following are printed: plate number, vehicle model, color, entry date and time.
When returning to the parking lot, the customer delivers the ticket. The time spent is calculated. Considering this time spent, the price table is applied, knowing that Saturday's table is not the same as weekdays' and sometimes, depending on the year of the season, the owners launch promotions during weekdays.
