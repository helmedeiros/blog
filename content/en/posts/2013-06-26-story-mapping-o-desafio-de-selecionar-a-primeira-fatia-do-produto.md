Story Mapping is developing the product in layers, where the first layer, which is the lowest part of a cake, can still be realized as a party, the more you learn and evolve the cake gains layers and can get better.

Baby.com.br entered the Brazilian market in 2012, using an existing platform to deliver as soon as possible.

After some time, the growth was restricted, and they started investing in their own platform after validating their business model.

In this scenario, Imbertti embarked on the adventure of baby and started sharing his knowledge and defending his method.

The team was distributed, and it was necessary to hold one's breath for a while I wrote several functionalities per minute in Basecamp.

As a result, Story Mapping was introduced, involving everyone.

Each functionality is described, prioritized, and defined as important for a specific user.

First, the backbone (spinal cord of the product) was written, defining preparation, purchase, delivery, support, and coverage of the service, with final analysis by the team.

These items are positioned at the top to guide where each story or task is.

The group started creating and presenting various tasks, at this moment the fear of agile teams may increase, or even demotivation.

There were many commercial, marketing, and other specialty restrictions.

What problem?

How do you make it happen?

Who should be listened to?

Mom, certainly...

Several restrictions were made, and the team started working on streamlining everything!

Effort was maximized, stories were ripped apart, and by constant delivery and learning, they evolved and trusted the rhythm.

Deployment triggers pulled the functionalities!

Mom says what's needed.

The goal is a product that goes to mom's house, all technical aspects for launch tested and tested, and now evolved!

Restrictions inspire creativity, value through the customer's perspective, and seek to validate their assumptions!
