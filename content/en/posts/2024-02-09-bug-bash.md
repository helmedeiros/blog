Bug bashes are one of those old-school, highly effective engineering rituals that somehow still feel underrated. If you work in a product team and haven't yet facilitated one, you're probably missing out on a powerful feedback loop just before release.

In this post, we'll walk through how we run bug bashes in the **Monetization Tribe**, what you need to set it up, who participates, and how to structure it for speed and alignment.

## What Is a Bug Bash?

A **bug bash** is a focused session where engineers, product managers, designers, and researchers come together to explore and test a feature before release. Unlike traditional QA, a bug bash aims to simulate real-world usage across multiple devices, browsers, roles, and perspectives.

> "It's not about testing to pass. It's about testing to break."

Bug bashes aren't there to replace automated or regression tests—they exist to expose blind spots, gather feedback from cross-functional perspectives, and uncover hard-to-reproduce issues.

## Why Do We Run Bug Bashes?

Here's why we do it every time we wrap a new product cycle:

- They help us **catch bugs early** and cheaply.
- They foster **team ownership** of quality.
- They expose the product to **real usage diversity** (devices, networks, roles).
- They build empathy and **shared context** across engineering, product, and design.
- They create a space for **collaboration** without blame.
- They **complement** our automated testing strategy with human perspectives.

| Benefit             | Why It Matters                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fast bug discovery  | Critical issues are surfaced before real users encounter them                 |
| Cross-team learning | Everyone gets hands-on time with parts of the product they don't own directly |
| Lower release risk  | We turn subjective assumptions into actionable bugs or improvements           |
| Human perspective   | Captures issues that automated tests can't detect                             |

## When Do We Run a Bug Bash?

We schedule a bug bash when:

- We're close to a **major release**.
- All user stories are complete and **merged into the feature environment**.
- There's **enough stability** that exploratory testing is meaningful.
- Our **automated tests are passing** and the codebase is stable.
- We want to **collect early signals** from broader usage.

Typically, we run the session **a week before release**—but we adjust based on scope and team readiness.

## Who Facilitates It?

In our tribe, engineers usually facilitate bug bashes. But facilitation can rotate to anyone willing to coordinate and keep the energy focused.

We recommend **two facilitators** per session to handle coordination, unblock participants, and manage documentation.

---

## How We Run It

We split the bug bash into four phases. Each one is short, intentional, and builds toward impact:

### 1. Preparation (15 min)

- Define the facilitators.
- Prepare the bug bash spreadsheet or board.
- Confirm access to staging environments or mobile builds.
- Share scope and testing instructions.
- Send calendar invite with RSVP and agenda.

```text
Checklist:
- [ ] Facilitator(s) defined
- [ ] Bug bash sheet created
- [ ] Access to feature env verified
- [ ] Calendar invite sent
```

---

### 2. Check-in & Kickoff (10 min)

- Check all participants can access tools and environments.
- Introduce the feature and what we're trying to explore.
- Emphasize **collaboration over perfection**—no blame if bugs are found.
- Remind folks to **log all findings** with:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Screenshots (if possible)
  - Device/browser info

---

### 3. Exploratory Session (50 min)

- Everyone explores the product independently.
- Facilitators monitor the bug sheet and unblock anyone stuck.
- Participants log findings directly into the shared doc.

We strongly recommend using a spreadsheet or Jira board with required fields:

- Title
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected vs. Actual
- Environment (browser/OS/device)
- Priority
- Reporter

---

### 4. Wrap-up & Prioritization (20 min)

- Designers and Product review all reported issues.
- Clarify whether issues are real bugs or misunderstandings.
- Assign priorities (P0–P2).
- Create Jira tickets from the top issues and tag them as `bugbash`.

> We only take what's critical into the current sprint.
> The rest can be groomed into the backlog.

## Final Thoughts

Bug bashes bring the team together to **own quality**, not outsource it. They promote curiosity, humility, and feedback. And they help you release with more confidence—because you're no longer guessing how people will use your product.
