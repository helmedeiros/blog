## A Year Later: Why We Built This Session

Almost a year has passed since we shared our experience running Session #2. Back then, we were excited about ideating milestones and shaping bets collaboratively. But over the following quarters, we hit a common wall—**we had great ideas, but not enough shared clarity around how complex they were, what they unlocked, or what they required**.

We've always believed in collaborative planning. We care about building a product culture where **autonomy, creativity, and accountability** thrive. And yet, we felt something was missing between ideation and execution.

The truth is: we needed a better way to talk about constraints. We needed a place to slow down, assess our ideas critically, and ask:

- What's the real cost of this idea?
- What skills are needed to validate it?
- What blocks us?

And so, gradually, we began to shape two new sessions:

- **Session #3**: to understand complexity and where we could learn faster
- **Session #4**: to layout a collaborative, visual draft of a quarter, highlighting risk, learning, and collaboration needs

Session #3 became our moment to reality-check the hypotheses we co-created in OKRA.

## 1. Translating Ideas Into Delivery Reality

By Session #3, your team has drafted OKRs and brainstormed candidate milestones. Now comes the hard but essential work: sizing, qualifying, and de-risking those ideas. This session is where we stop imagining and start grounding.

Every milestone is a bet—but not all bets are equal. Some require coordination. Others are low-hanging fruit. Some have high UX payoff but unclear technical feasibility. Session #3 gives us the shared language and structured time to turn that ambiguity into alignment.

| When to Run           | Purpose                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| After Session #2      | Milestones exist but haven't been sized, scoped, or tested |
| Before Planning Phase | Ensures we're sequencing based on real constraints         |

This session isn't where you plan your quarter. It's where you learn what's actually possible.

## 2. What the Session Looks Like

We don't run this session like a spreadsheet. We run it like a collaborative draft board. Here's the structure:

1. **Milestone Review** – Go one by one. A teammate presents a milestone card and walks through context.
2. **Effort Estimation** – The group sizes the milestone (`S/M/L`), using heuristics based on prior delivery experience.
3. **Business & UX Value** – Participants score the milestone on business impact (`$/$$/$$$`) and UX value (`♥/♥♥/♥♥♥`).
4. **Dependencies** – Team calls out any blocking coordination, e.g. Platform, BI, DS, or external providers.
5. **Skills Needed** – In pairs, identify core skills needed to deliver the milestone (e.g., Design, Frontend, Backend).

```bash
# Example layout
okra/
├── session-3/
│   ├── milestone-table.csv
│   ├── effort-size.md
│   ├── value-scores.md
│   └── dependencies-skills.md
```

No one owns the truth in this session. It's about surfacing assumptions.

## 3. Scoring Isn't About Precision—It's About Conversation

Don't waste cycles debating if something is Medium or Large. The goal is shared understanding, not perfect math. Scoring helps your team:

- Balance short bets vs. long-term investments
- Sequence based on value or technical constraints
- Avoid overcommitting by visualizing effort vs. payoff

| Attribute      | Scale          | Used To...                               |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Effort         | `S / M / L`    | Estimate delivery complexity             |
| Business Value | `$ / $$ / $$$` | Predict monetization or strategic payoff |
| UX Value       | `♥ / ♥♥ / ♥♥♥` | Reflect end-user experience impact       |
| Dependencies   | Free text      | Reveal coordination needs & risks        |
| Skills         | Free text      | Clarify resource needs for planning      |

Color coding or emoji isn't just decoration—it makes patterns pop.

## 4. Common Pitfalls We've Learned to Avoid

We've run this session many times. Here's what breaks it:

- **Letting only PMs or Tech Leads estimate** — This session is richer when everyone speaks.
- **Skipping dependency review** — One invisible blocker can break your quarter.
- **Not aligning on what S/M/L means** — Write it down. Use examples.
- **Over-scoring everything as high value** — Not everything is top priority. Prioritization needs contrast.

Make this session a safe space to express uncertainty. Estimations are signals—not promises.

## 5. What You Leave With

By the end, your team will have:

- A complete, team-scored milestone table
- Shared clarity around feasibility, value, and constraints
- Aligned assumptions on what will move the needle

This becomes the foundation for the next phase: building the visual plan and committing to sequencing. In Session #4, you'll put these cards on the timeline. But this session? It ensures they belong in the deck.

```markdown
Milestone: Enable smart match recommendations
Effort: M
Business Value: $$
UX Value: ♥♥
Dependencies: Ranking system API, DS support
Skills: Frontend, DS, Product Analytics
```
