This is the third lecture given along with the software engineering discipline of <a href="http://unp.br" target="_blank">Universidade Potiguar</a>, where the foundation for choosing a sequential process-based model is presented and defined for resolving known and immutable problems.

The waterfall model and its incompatibility with real-life scenarios are displayed... developing software isn't building a building. [slideshare id=3331054&doc=unp-aula3-100303204328-phpapp01]
