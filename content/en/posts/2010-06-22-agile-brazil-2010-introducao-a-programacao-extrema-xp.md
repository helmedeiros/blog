Officially, <a title="Agile Brazil 2010" href="http://www.agilebrazil.com/" target="_blank">Agile Brazil 2010</a> started today!

Like any good event with great speakers, Agile Brazil has been preparing for me for some time now with the publication of the schedule, which tried to help us with related tracks based on participants' familiarity and expertise... but it didn't help me much!!

It happens that in our scenario, where large amounts of information are launched on blogs without concrete functionality, good talks, even basic ones, are always desirable; delivered in capable hands, 45 minutes can take away your floor and build it in a totally new way, which is what I expect from Agile Brazil

 2010.

At this hour, the experience and openness of the speakers will make all the difference.

I saw an unconventional format that caught my attention and with some contacts, I chose the first course I would participate in at the event.

Good grade, good instructors, and many participants; bring your notebook because we'll implement something in an extreme universe... it could only be very interesting. [<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-206" src="/uploads/2010/06/DSC04413.jpg" alt="XP

At this point, an element emerged that would be part of most of the event, namely <a title="Pomodoro" href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">POMODORO TIMER</a>, as there was a vast subject to be explored and even more baggage of examples, cases, and other things from our 6 instructors' domain; but there was a path to follow to reach the expected content, and tomatoes were defined for each theme, with each one taking turns until it sounded for the first time, and we began our immersion in XP.

Our second tomato raised expectations within the group for the course; at this moment, an open space was created where everyone could transfer their post-its, which were subsequently grouped by similarities and defended before the class about what would be addressed and on what level it would be addressed.

The third tomato focused on presenting chaos reports and how XP works with team cultures to focus on achieving the software parcel that will actually be used.

In this context, Daniel put forth an interesting example that removed some misconceptions from people's heads about the first version of XP, which treated code above people and respect.

Agility and XP expect simplicity, but also respect, and the combination of these is against what ifs.

You won't create something as simple as disrespecting your team, software, and client. "Simplicity is the art of maximizing what's not done"'.

Removing fat is desirable, but the product must obtain respect from everyone, including yours!

Some consecutive tomatoes explored history, the XP life cycle, principles, values, and practices, and at the end, a theoretical and cultural practice focused on relationship and application of learned concepts for creating an ATM.

As usual, several teams failed to execute, with some parts of the team involved in practices and others not, something quite common in our daily lives.

In the afternoon, there was a paired development session on a simple problem, converting numbers from English to writing, done in groups. <figure id="attachment_205" style="width: 417px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"> [<img class="size-full wp-image-205" src="/uploads/2010/06/DSC044221.jpg" alt="XP

Worth it!!
