On days 22 and 23 of October, your <a href="http://congressocientifico.unp.br/jportal/portal.jsf?pagina=12005" target="_blank">décimo primeiro congresso científico</a> will be rolled out on <a href="http://unp.br" target="_blank">Universidade Potiguar &#8211; RN</a>.

This year I was invited by the course direction of systems of information to give a mini-SCRUM course, "How to transform teams into high-performance teams with repetitive value deliveries to clients in eight hours".

I attended as a student some of these congresses listening to lectures from my current boss Prof. Paulo Benício about Open-GL programming, at the time the congresses were excellent and I hope this year will be even better!

The <a href="http://admin.unp.br/UserFiles/File/Atividades_Programacao_19%2010%202009.pdf" target="_blank">programação</a> is quite different, presenting current topics. Well, you can't miss it anyway! See you there!
