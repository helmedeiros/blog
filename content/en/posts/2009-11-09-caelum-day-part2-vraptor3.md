> **Series: Caelum Day 2009** | **Part 2 of 7** > _Comprehensive coverage of cutting-edge talks from Rio's premier Java event_

**Continuing our series**, I'm still buzzing from **Guilherme Silveira and Filipe Sabella's** presentation on **VRaptor 3**. As someone who's been wrestling with Struts and Spring MVC, what I saw on stage felt like a breath of fresh air for Java web development.

## Finally, Convention Over Configuration for Java

What really got my attention was how VRaptor 3 tackles the XML configuration hell that we Java developers know all too well. While we're used to frameworks like Struts requiring tons of XML setup, VRaptor is embracing the **"convention over configuration"** philosophy that's making Rails so popular.

## What Made Me Sit Up and Take Notice

The live demo was pretty impressive. Here's what stood out:

- **Smart URL mapping**: Controllers and methods just work without configuration files
- **Dependency injection**: Built-in IoC that actually makes sense
- **View resolution**: No more mapping every JSP manually
- **JSON/XML support**: AJAX responses that just work out of the box
- **Interceptors**: Clean way to handle things like authentication and logging

## Brazilian Software on the World Stage

There's something really exciting about seeing **Brazilian developers** building something that could compete internationally. VRaptor feels like a **"made in Brazil"** solution that doesn't compromise on quality or features. The documentation is in Portuguese, which makes it more accessible for local teams.

## The Live Demo Was Eye-Opening

Watching Guilherme and Filipe build a working application in real-time was incredible. They showed how to:

1. Create a controller with just a few lines of code
2. Handle form submissions without any configuration
3. Return JSON for AJAX calls automatically
4. Build clean, readable URLs

The amount of **boilerplate code they eliminated** compared to what I'm used to was remarkable. It felt like they were coding at the speed of thought.

## I Want to Try This

VRaptor is open source and I'm definitely planning to check it out:
[VRaptor on GitHub](https://github.com/caelum/vraptor)

## Could This Change Java Web Development?

If VRaptor 3 delivers on its promises, it might prove that Java web development doesn't have to be the painful, verbose experience we've accepted. Maybe we can have **Rails-like productivity** without giving up the Java ecosystem we know and love.

I'm curious to see how this plays out. The Java community has been looking for something like this for a while.

**Next in the series:** How Sergio Junior and Luiz Costa are making REST finally make sense!
