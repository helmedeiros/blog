Continuing this series on Caelum Day in Rio, today's post is about the talk by **Guilherme Silveira and Filipe Sabella** on **VRaptor 3**.

If you had ever used previous versions of VRaptor or frameworks like Struts, what we saw was **a real leap in productivity and simplicity**.

## A New Way of Doing Web in Java

VRaptor 3 aims to be lighter, more fluent, and far less bureaucratic.
Things that used to require XML, heavy configuration, or boilerplate code now work with:

- Smart conventions
- Dependency injection using CDI/Guice
- Clean, direct controllers with clear routes and methods

Watching their live demo felt like seeing someone lift a weight off the shoulders of Java web developers.

## What I Really Liked

- **Clean, friendly URLs** without extra configuration
- Simple integration with Spring and other frameworks
- Easy-to-write tests that don't require spinning up a full server
- Clear separation of concerns in the Controller classes

Sabella also brought a great sense of humor and real-world examples that made everything more engaging. The two had a great dynamic on stage.

## A Framework Built Here

One thing that stood out to me was the reminder that VRaptor is **built by Brazilian developers**, with an active open-source community and documentation in Portuguese.

That makes the project feel more accessible and gives me more motivation to try it out — and maybe even contribute.

## Check Out the Code

VRaptor is open source and you can explore the codebase on GitHub:

## Final Thoughts

VRaptor 3 seems to solve a lot of pain points from older frameworks, without trying to reinvent everything. It respects what already works in the Java ecosystem while making development much smoother.

**Next up in this series:** Sergio Junior and Luiz Costa's talk on RESTful APIs. Stay tuned!
