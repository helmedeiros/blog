> **Series: Caelum Day 2009** | **Part 2 of 7** > _Comprehensive coverage of cutting-edge talks from Rio's premier Java event_

**Continuing our series**, today I want to talk about the presentation by **Guilherme Silveira and Filipe Sabella** on **VRaptor 3**, Caelum's Java MVC framework that aims to bring **convention over configuration** to the Java world.

## VRaptor as Brazil's Answer to Rails

What impressed me most was how VRaptor 3 tackles the complexity that often comes with Java web development. While frameworks like Struts require extensive XML configuration, VRaptor follows the **"convention over configuration"** philosophy popularized by Ruby on Rails.

## Key Features That Stood Out

- **Intelligent URL mapping**: Controllers and methods map to URLs automatically
- **Dependency injection**: Built-in IoC container for clean architecture
- **View resolution**: Automatic JSP/template mapping based on naming conventions
- **JSON/XML support**: Easy API development with automatic serialization
- **Interceptors**: Clean way to handle cross-cutting concerns

## The Brazilian Software Development Context

What made this talk especially meaningful was seeing **Brazilian developers** contributing to the global Java ecosystem. VRaptor represents a **"made in Brazil"** solution that competes with international frameworks while addressing the specific needs of local development teams.

## Practical Demonstration

Guilherme and Filipe showed how quickly you can:

1. Create a controller with minimal code
2. Handle form submissions automatically
3. Render JSON responses for AJAX calls
4. Implement clean URL structures

The amount of **boilerplate code elimination** compared to traditional Java web frameworks was remarkable.

## Explore VRaptor

VRaptor is open source and you can explore the framework on GitHub:

## What This Means for Java Development

VRaptor 3 shows that Java web development doesn't have to be verbose and configuration-heavy. It's possible to have the **productivity of Rails** while keeping the **robustness and ecosystem of Java**.

For developers tired of XML hell and complex setup, VRaptor offers a refreshing alternative that feels modern and intuitive.

**Next in the series:** Sergio Junior and Luiz Costa's talk on RESTful APIs!
