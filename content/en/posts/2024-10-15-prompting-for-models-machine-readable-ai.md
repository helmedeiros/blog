# Prompting for Models, Not Just Humans

## Why We Must Learn to Write for Machines

Generative AI has already changed how we draft, create, and communicate. But one of the most overlooked skills is also one of the most foundational: **writing prompts that machines understand—and other machines can replicate.**

This post isn't about writing faster. It's about writing _clearly_ and _structurally_, so that your intent can be reliably followed by LLMs—today and in future iterations.

## A Mental Shift: You're Writing to a Translator, Not a Mind Reader

LLMs (like GPT-4o) don't "understand" the way humans do. They **interpret patterns in text** based on massive amounts of data, without knowledge of your exact goal. A vague or informal request may still yield a good guess—but when you need reliability, especially across models or toolchains, **guessing isn't enough**.

Instead, we must learn to write instructions that are:

- **Unambiguous**
- **Modular**
- **Model-portable**
- **Reviewable by others**

This is especially important when you're creating prompts that will be reused, embedded in a GPT, or passed between tools.

## Prompting That Teaches the Model How to Think

One of the best tools I've used lately is a **meta-prompt**—a prompt that asks the model to help _improve your prompt_. Here's the core idea:

### Meta-Prompt for Expert Prompt Creation

```markdown
I want you to become my Expert Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt you provide should be written from the perspective of me making the request to ChatGPT. Consider in your prompt creation that this prompt will be entered into an interface for GPT-4o. The prompt will include instructions to write the output using my communication style. The process is as follows:

1. You will generate the following sections:

**Prompt:**

> {provide the best possible prompt according to my request}
>
> {summarize my prior messages to you and provide them as examples of my communication style}

**Critique:**
{provide a concise paragraph on how to improve the prompt. Be very critical in your response. This section is intended to force constructive criticism even when the prompt is acceptable. Any assumptions and or issues should be included}

**Questions:**
{ask any questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt (max of 3). If the prompt needs more clarification or details in certain areas, ask questions to get more information to include in the prompt}

2. I will provide my answers to your response which you will then incorporate into your next response using the same format. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt until the prompt is perfected.
```

This prompt creates a collaborative loop—perfect for crafting reusable, role-based instructions or automations. It helps you document **what** you want and **how** you express it.

## Why This Matters for GPTs and AI Workflows

Many AI-powered tools today rely on structured prompts behind the scenes:

- GPTs you create in ChatGPT
- AI agents like AutoGPT or CrewAI
- Workflow builders in tools like Zapier, Make, or LangChain

To make them robust, your prompts need to:

- Specify roles
- Handle edge cases
- Follow your style
- Be iteratively refined with feedback loops

## Final Takeaway

We're not just talking to machines anymore—we're teaching them how to collaborate with us.

And for that, we must write prompts that are readable, reusable, and reliable. If you're serious about working with AI—start writing for the model, not just for yourself.

Let's build prompts that think.
