> **Series: Kanban to Scrum Transition** | **Part 3 of 4** | _Documenting our team's structured evolution from Kanban to Scrum_

## From Facilitation to Enablement

After designing our ceremonies and aligning as a team, the process needed momentum. At first, I facilitated all Scrum sessions — daily syncs, planning, retros, reviews, and refinements. It wasn't just about running the meetings. It was about modeling how we wanted these spaces to feel: safe, focused, and purpose-driven.

But my ultimate goal was not to be the facilitator — it was to enable the team to **own the process**.

---

## Coaching Through Participation

I began inviting one engineer at a time to co-facilitate a session with me. We'd meet briefly beforehand to prepare, and after the session, I'd give feedback — affirming what worked and offering tips for engagement, time management, and clarity.

It wasn't about being polished. It was about **presence**. Holding space. Reading the room. Asking the next good question.

Each time, the co-facilitator gained more confidence. And the team began to see that facilitation wasn't a role tied to hierarchy — it was something we could all learn.

---

## The Playbooks We Built

To support this journey, we created short facilitation guides — one-pagers for each ceremony:

- **Daily Sync**: goal, timebox, common blockers.
- **Refinement**: prompts to assess readiness and complexity.
- **Planning**: connecting stories to sprint goals and capacity.
- **Review**: structure for sharing outcomes and learning.
- **Retro**: structure, techniques (Start/Stop/Continue, 4Ls, etc.), and examples.

These playbooks weren't mandatory. They were **starting points** — helping people feel grounded as they stepped into facilitation.

---

## Gradual Ownership and Rotation

We didn't create a rota overnight. First, a few engineers volunteered. Then we started rotating facilitators every week. If someone was uncertain, they'd pair with a buddy or use a template.

Eventually, everyone on the team felt comfortable — not just leading, but shaping how we facilitated together.

What surprised me most was how facilitation changed the facilitators. People asked better questions. Noticed dynamics. Practiced empathy. Leading created leaders.

---

## Leadership as Multiplication

The shift wasn't about replacing me. It was about **distributing ownership**. And with that came increased engagement, deeper conversations, and more resilient collaboration.

Scrum became not something _we follow_, but something _we own_. The ceremonies were no longer events on a calendar. They were **reflective practices**, and anyone could hold that space.

In Part 4, I'll walk you through each of those plays and how they're adapted for our context.

# Coaching log idea
echo "Who can I support to lead next week's retro?" >> team_growth_log.txt
