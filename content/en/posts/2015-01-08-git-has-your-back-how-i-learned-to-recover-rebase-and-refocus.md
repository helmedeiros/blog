## When Panic Meets Power

There was a night in early January where I thought I had ruined everything. I accidentally reset the wrong branch and lost a full day of work. I stared at the terminal in silence. My hands got cold. My only instinct was to open Slack and type "I messed up."

But before I hit enter, I paused. I remembered something I'd seen weeks earlier: `git reflog`. A command I had ignored. I typed it in desperation.

There it was. A breadcrumb trail of HEAD changes. I wasn't dead in the water—I was just a few commands away from recovering everything. And that moment rewired my brain.

Git wasn't a danger. It was a time machine. And if I learned how to use it, I could not only recover—I'd move faster and more confidently than ever.

## Recovery Is a Skill, Not a Rescue

Too often, developers treat Git like it's one click away from disaster. But the truth is: it's more forgiving than it looks—if you know where to look.

Let's talk about the recovery commands I learned to trust:

```bash
git reflog
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
git cherry-pick
git stash pop
```

| Command            | What It Helps With                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `git reflog`       | View history of HEAD movements      |
| `git reset --hard` | Jump back to a known state          |
| `git cherry-pick`  | Recover specific commits            |
| `git stash pop`    | Restore temporarily stashed changes |

Each of these gave me power over my mistakes. Instead of fearing loss, I got used to exploring history. Instead of starting over, I started learning from what I _almost_ lost.

That changed how I worked. I became bolder, but more intentional. Git gave me that safety net.

## Rebasing Is Worth Learning

Rebase scared me for months. Every time someone said "interactive rebase," I imagined terminal chaos. But eventually, I had to face it. My PRs were messy. My commits were out of order. My teammates spent too much time guessing what was meaningful.

I started small:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

Then I practiced rewriting messages, squashing fixes, and reordering history.

| Task                     | Rebase Operation                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Clean up small typos     | `reword`                        |
| Reorder logic commits    | Move lines in the rebase editor |
| Combine related work     | `fixup` or `squash`             |
| Drop unnecessary changes | `drop`                          |

The first few times were slow. But then it clicked. Rebasing wasn't rewriting history. It was _clarifying_ it.

Now, I never submit a PR without reviewing my commit history first. It's part of how I respect my team's time. And it's part of how I lead by example—even in code.

## Git as a Growth Mindset

Git doesn't just store your code. It teaches you about yourself.

Are you cautious? Chaotic? Are you repeating mistakes or learning from them?

Learning to recover made me calm. Learning to rebase made me clean. And together, they made me fast.

So next time something breaks, don't panic. Open the terminal. Trust the tools. And know that Git has your back.

Mistakes aren't the end. With Git, they're just a place to start again.
